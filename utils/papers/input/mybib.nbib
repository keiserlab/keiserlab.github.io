TI  - Deep phenotypic profiling of neuroactive drugs in larval zebrafish.
PG  - 9955
LID - 10.1038/s41467-024-54375-y [doi]
AB  - Behavioral larval zebrafish screens leverage a high-throughput small
      molecule discovery format to find neuroactive molecules relevant to
      mammalian physiology. We screen a library of 650 central nervous system
      active compounds in high replicate to train deep metric learning models
      on zebrafish behavioral profiles. The machine learning initially
      exploited subtle artifacts in the phenotypic screen, necessitating a
      complete experimental re-run with rigorous physical well-wise
      randomization. These large matched phenotypic screening datasets (initial
      and well-randomized) provide a unique opportunity to quantify and
      understand shortcut learning in a full-scale, real-world drug discovery
      dataset. The final deep metric learning model substantially outperforms
      correlation distance-the canonical way of computing distances between
      profiles-and generalizes to an orthogonal dataset of diverse drug-like
      compounds. We validate predictions by prospective in vitro radio-ligand
      binding assays against human protein targets, achieving a hit rate of 58%
      despite crossing species and chemical scaffold boundaries. These
      neuroactive compounds exhibit diverse chemical scaffolds, demonstrating
      that zebrafish phenotypic screens combined with metric learning achieve
      robust scaffold hopping capabilities.

AB  - Make-on-demand chemical libraries have drastically increased the reach of
      molecular docking, with the enumerated ready-to-dock ZINC-22 library
      approaching 6.4 billion molecules (July 2024). While ever-growing
      libraries result in better-scoring molecules, the computational resources
      required to dock all of ZINC-22 make this endeavor infeasible for most.
      Here, we organize and traverse chemical space with hierarchical navigable
      small-world graphs, a method we term retrieval augmented docking (RAD).
      RAD recovers most virtual actives, despite docking only a fraction of the
      library. Furthermore, RAD is protein-agnostic, supporting additional
      docking campaigns without additional computational overhead. In depth, we
      assess RAD on published large-scale docking campaigns against D4 and AmpC
      spanning 99.5 million and 138 million molecules, respectively. RAD
      recovers 95% of DOCK virtual actives for both targets after evaluating
      only 10% of the libraries. In breadth, RAD shows widespread applicability
      against 43 DUDE-Z proteins, evaluating 50.3 million associations. On
      average, RAD recovers 87% of virtual actives while docking 10% of the
      library without sacrificing chemical diversity.

TI  - Learning chemical sensitivity reveals mechanisms of cellular response.
PG  - 1149
LID - 10.1038/s42003-024-06865-4 [doi]
AB  - Chemical probes interrogate disease mechanisms at the molecular level by
      linking genetic changes to observable traits. However, comprehensive
      chemical screens in diverse biological models are impractical. To address
      this challenge, we develop ChemProbe, a model that predicts cellular
      sensitivity to hundreds of molecular probes and drugs by learning to
      combine transcriptomes and chemical structures. Using ChemProbe, we infer
      the chemical sensitivity of cancer cell lines and tumor samples and
      analyze how the model makes predictions. We retrospectively evaluate drug
      response predictions for precision breast cancer treatment and
      prospectively validate chemical sensitivity predictions in new cellular
      models, including a genetically modified cell line. Our model
      interpretation analysis identifies transcriptome features reflecting
      compound targets and protein network modules, identifying genes that
      drive ferroptosis. ChemProbe is an interpretable in silico screening tool
      that allows researchers to measure cellular response to diverse
      compounds, facilitating research into molecular mechanisms of chemical
      sensitivity.

AB  - Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) on molecular graphs generate
      continuous and differentiable encodings of small molecules with state-of-
      the-art performance on protein-ligand complex scoring tasks. Here, we
      describe the proximity graph network (PGN) package, an open-source
      toolkit that constructs ligand-receptor graphs based on atom proximity
      and allows users to rapidly apply and evaluate MPNN architectures for a
      broad range of tasks. We demonstrate the utility of PGN by introducing
      benchmarks for affinity and docking score prediction tasks. Graph
      networks generalize better than fingerprint-based models and perform
      strongly for the docking score prediction task. Overall, MPNNs with
      proximity graph data structures augment the prediction of ligand-receptor
      complex properties when ligand-receptor data are available.

TI  - Toward a generalizable machine learning workflow for neurodegenerative
      disease staging with focus on neurofibrillary tangles.
PG  - 202
LID - 10.1186/s40478-023-01691-x [doi]
AB  - Machine learning (ML) has increasingly been used to assist and expand
      current practices in neuropathology. However, generating large imaging
      datasets with quality labels is challenging in fields which demand high
      levels of expertise. Further complicating matters is the often seen
      disagreement between experts in neuropathology-related tasks, both at the
      case level and at a more granular level. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
      are a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer disease, and are
      associated with disease progression which warrants further investigation
      and granular quantification at a scale not currently accessible in
      routine human assessment. In this work, we first provide a baseline of
      annotator/rater agreement for the tasks of Braak NFT staging between
      experts and NFT detection using both experts and novices in
      neuropathology. We use a whole-slide-image (WSI) cohort of neuropathology
      cases from Emory University Hospital immunohistochemically stained for
      Tau. We develop a workflow for gathering annotations of the early stage
      formation of NFTs (Pre-NFTs) and mature intracellular (iNFTs) and show ML
      models can be trained to learn annotator nuances for the task of NFT
      detection in WSIs. We utilize a model-assisted-labeling approach and
      demonstrate ML models can be used to aid in labeling large datasets
      efficiently. We also show these models can be used to extract case-level
      features, which predict Braak NFT stages comparable to expert human
      raters, and do so at scale. This study provides a generalizable workflow
      for various pathology and related fields, and also provides a technique
      for accomplishing a high-level neuropathology task with limited human
      annotations.

AB  - Natural and experimental genetic variants can modify DNA loops and
      insulating boundaries to tune transcription, but it is unknown how
      sequence perturbations affect chromatin organization genome wide. We
      developed a deep-learning strategy to quantify the effect of any
      insertion, deletion, or substitution on chromatin contacts and
      systematically scored millions of synthetic variants. While most genetic
      manipulations have little impact, regions with CTCF motifs and active
      transcription are highly sensitive, as expected. Our unbiased screen and
      subsequent targeted experiments also point to noncoding RNA genes and
      several families of repetitive elements as CTCF-motif-free DNA sequences
      with particularly large effects on nearby chromatin interactions,
      sometimes exceeding the effects of CTCF sites and explaining interactions
      that lack CTCF. We anticipate that our disruption tracks may be of broad
      interest and utility as a measure of 3D genome sensitivity, and our
      computational strategies may serve as a template for biological inquiry
      with deep learning.

AB  - Precise, scalable, and quantitative evaluation of whole slide images is
      crucial in neuropathology. We release a deep learning model for rapid
      object detection and precise information on the identification, locality,
      and counts of cored plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We
      trained this object detector using a repurposed image-tile dataset
      without any human-drawn bounding boxes. We evaluated the detector on a
      new manually-annotated dataset of whole slide images (WSIs) from three
      institutions, four staining procedures, and four human experts. The
      detector matched the cohort of neuropathology experts, achieving 0.64
      (model) vs. 0.64 (cohort) average precision (AP) for cored plaques and
      0.75 vs. 0.51 AP for CAAs at a 0.5 IOU threshold. It provided count and
      locality predictions that approximately correlated with gold-standard
      human CERAD-like WSI scoring (p = 0.07 +/- 0.10). The openly-available
      model can quickly score WSIs in minutes without a GPU on a standard
      workstation.

TI  - Prioritizing Virtual Screening with Interpretable Interaction
      Fingerprints.
PG  - 4300-4318
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00695 [doi]
AB  - Machine learning-based drug discovery success depends on molecular
      representation. Yet traditional molecular fingerprints omit both the
      protein and pointers back to structural information that would enable
      better model interpretability. Therefore, we propose LUNA, a Python 3
      toolkit that calculates and encodes protein-ligand interactions into new
      hashed fingerprints inspired by Extended Connectivity FingerPrint (ECFP):
      EIFP (Extended Interaction FingerPrint), FIFP (Functional Interaction
      FingerPrint), and Hybrid Interaction FingerPrint (HIFP). LUNA also
      provides visual strategies to make the fingerprints interpretable. We
      performed three major experiments exploring the fingerprints' use. First,
      we trained machine learning models to reproduce DOCK3.7 scores using 1
      million docked Dopamine D4 complexes. We found that EIFP-4,096 performed
      (R(2) = 0.61) superior to related molecular and interaction fingerprints.
      Second, we used LUNA to support interpretable machine learning models.
      Finally, we demonstrate that interaction fingerprints can accurately
      identify similarities across molecular complexes that other fingerprints
      overlook. Hence, we envision LUNA and its interface fingerprints as
      promising methods for machine learning-based virtual screening campaigns.
      LUNA is freely available at https://github.com/keiserlab/LUNA.

      Alzheimer's disease therapeutics.
PG  - 583-595
LID - 10.1038/s42256-022-00490-8 [doi]
AB  - In microscopy-based drug screens, fluorescent markers carry critical
      information on how compounds affect different biological processes.
      However, practical considerations, such as the labor and preparation
      formats needed to produce different image channels, hinders the use of
      certain fluorescent markers. Consequently, completed screens may lack
      biologically informative but experimentally impractical markers. Here, we
      present a deep learning method for overcoming these limitations. We
      accurately generated predicted fluorescent signals from other related
      markers and validated this new machine learning (ML) method on two
      biologically distinct datasets. We used the ML method to improve the
      selection of biologically active compounds for Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      from a completed high-content high-throughput screen (HCS) that had only
      contained the original markers. The ML method identified novel compounds
      that effectively blocked tau aggregation, which had been missed by
      traditional screening approaches unguided by ML. The method improved
      triaging efficiency of compound rankings over conventional rankings by
      raw image channels. We reproduced this ML pipeline on a biologically
      independent cancer-based dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The
      approach is disease-agnostic and applicable across diverse fluorescence
      microscopy datasets.

AB  - Pathologists can label pathologies differently, making it challenging to
      yield consistent assessments in the absence of one ground truth. To
      address this problem, we present a deep learning (DL) approach that draws
      on a cohort of experts, weighs each contribution, and is robust to noisy
      labels. We collected 100,495 annotations on 20,099 candidate amyloid beta
      neuropathologies (cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and cored and
      diffuse plaques) from three institutions, independently annotated by five
      experts. DL methods trained on a consensus-of-two strategy yielded
      12.6-26% improvements by area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC)
      when compared to those that learned individualized annotations. This
      strategy surpassed individual-expert models, even when unfairly assessed
      on benchmarks favoring them. Moreover, ensembling over individual models
      was robust to hidden random annotators. In blind prospective tests of
      52,555 subsequent expert-annotated images, the models labeled pathologies
      like their human counterparts (consensus model AUPRC = 0.74 cored; 0.69
      CAA). This study demonstrates a means to combine multiple ground truths
      into a common-ground DL model that yields consistent diagnoses informed
      by multiple and potentially variable expert opinions.

AB  - Artificial intelligence models match or exceed dermatologists in melanoma
      image classification. Less is known about their robustness against real-
      world variations, and clinicians may incorrectly assume that a model with
      an acceptable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve or
      related performance metric is ready for clinical use. Here, we
      systematically assessed the performance of dermatologist-level
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on real-world non-curated images by
      applying computational "stress tests". Our goal was to create a proxy
      environment in which to comprehensively test the generalizability of off-
      the-shelf CNNs developed without training or evaluation protocols
      specific to individual clinics. We found inconsistent predictions on
      images captured repeatedly in the same setting or subjected to simple
      transformations (e.g., rotation). Such transformations resulted in false
      positive or negative predictions for 6.5-22% of skin lesions across test
      datasets. Our findings indicate that models meeting conventionally
      reported metrics need further validation with computational stress tests
      to assess clinic readiness.

AB  - Multitask deep neural networks learn to predict ligand-target binding by
      example, yet public pharmacological data sets are sparse, imbalanced, and
      approximate. We constructed two hold-out benchmarks to approximate
      temporal and drug-screening test scenarios, whose characteristics differ
      from a random split of conventional training data sets. We developed a
      pharmacological data set augmentation procedure, Stochastic Negative
      Addition (SNA), which randomly assigns untested molecule-target pairs as
      transient negative examples during training. Under the SNA procedure,
      drug-screening benchmark performance increases from R(2) = 0.1926 +/-
      0.0186 to 0.4269 +/- 0.0272 (122%). This gain was accompanied by a modest
      decrease in the temporal benchmark (13%). SNA increases in drug-screening
      performance were consistent for classification and regression tasks and
      outperformed y-randomized controls. Our results highlight where data and
      feature uncertainty may be problematic and how leveraging uncertainty
      into training improves predictions of drug-target relationships.

TI  - Learning Molecular Representations for Medicinal Chemistry.
PG  - 8705-8722
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00385 [doi]
AB  - The accurate modeling and prediction of small molecule properties and
      bioactivities depend on the critical choice of molecular representation.
      Decades of informatics-driven research have relied on expert-designed
      molecular descriptors to establish quantitative structure-activity and
      structure-property relationships for drug discovery. Now, advances in
      deep learning make it possible to efficiently and compactly learn
      molecular representations directly from data. In this review, we discuss
      how active research in molecular deep learning can address limitations of
      current descriptors and fingerprints while creating new opportunities in
      cheminformatics and virtual screening. We provide a concise overview of
      the role of representations in cheminformatics, key concepts in deep
      learning, and argue that learning representations provides a way forward
      to improve the predictive modeling of small molecule bioactivities and
      properties.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important in
      dermatology, with studies reporting accuracy matching or exceeding
      dermatologists for the diagnosis of skin lesions from clinical and
      dermoscopic images. However, real-world clinical validation is currently
      lacking. We review dermatological applications of deep learning, the
      leading artificial intelligence technology for image analysis, and
      discuss its current capabilities, potential failure modes, and challenges
      surrounding performance assessment and interpretability. We address the
      following three primary applications: (i) teledermatology, including
      triage for referral to dermatologists; (ii) augmenting clinical
      assessment during face-to-face visits; and (iii) dermatopathology. We
      discuss equity and ethical issues related to future clinical adoption and
      recommend specific standardization of metrics for reporting model
      performance.

TI  - Validation of machine learning models to detect amyloid pathologies
      across institutions.
PG  - 59

AB  - Semi-quantitative scoring schemes like the Consortium to Establish a
      Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) are the most commonly used
      method in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology practice. Computational
      approaches based on machine learning have recently generated quantitative
      scores for whole slide images (WSIs) that are highly correlated with
      human derived semi-quantitative scores, such as those of CERAD, for
      Alzheimer's disease pathology. However, the robustness of such models
      have yet to be tested in different cohorts. To validate previously
      published machine learning algorithms using convolutional neural networks
      (CNNs) and determine if pathological heterogeneity may alter algorithm
      derived measures, 40 cases from the Goizueta Emory Alzheimer's Disease
      Center brain bank displaying an array of pathological diagnoses
      (including AD with and without Lewy body disease (LBD), and / or
      TDP-43-positive inclusions) and levels of Abeta pathologies were
      evaluated. Furthermore, to provide deeper phenotyping, amyloid burden in
      gray matter vs whole tissue were compared, and quantitative CNN scores
      for both correlated significantly to CERAD-like scores. Quantitative
      scores also show clear stratification based on AD pathologies with or
      without additional diagnoses (including LBD and TDP-43 inclusions) vs
      cases with no significant neurodegeneration (control cases) as well as
      NIA Reagan scoring criteria. Specifically, the concomitant diagnosis
      group of AD + TDP-43 showed significantly greater CNN-score for cored
      plaques than the AD group. Finally, we report that whole tissue
      computational scores correlate better with CERAD-like categories than
      focusing on computational scores from a field of view with densest
      pathology, which is the standard of practice in neuropathological
      assessment per CERAD guidelines. Together these findings validate and
      expand CNN models to be robust to cohort variations and provide
      additional proof-of-concept for future studies to incorporate machine
      learning algorithms into neuropathological practice.

TI  - Zebrafish behavioural profiling identifies GABA and serotonin receptor
      ligands related to sedation and paradoxical excitation.
PG  - 4078
LID - 10.1038/s41467-019-11936-w [doi]
AB  - Anesthetics are generally associated with sedation, but some anesthetics
      can also increase brain and motor activity-a phenomenon known as
      paradoxical excitation. Previous studies have identified GABAA receptors
      as the primary targets of most anesthetic drugs, but how these compounds
      produce paradoxical excitation is poorly understood. To identify and
      understand such compounds, we applied a behavior-based drug profiling
      approach. Here, we show that a subset of central nervous system
      depressants cause paradoxical excitation in zebrafish. Using this
      behavior as a readout, we screened thousands of compounds and identified
      dozens of hits that caused paradoxical excitation. Many hit compounds
      modulated human GABAA receptors, while others appeared to modulate
      different neuronal targets, including the human serotonin-6 receptor.
      Ligands at these receptors generally decreased neuronal activity, but
      paradoxically increased activity in the caudal hindbrain. Together, these
      studies identify ligands, targets, and neurons affecting sedation and
      paradoxical excitation in vivo in zebrafish.

AB  - Neuropathologists assess vast brain areas to identify diverse and subtly-
      differentiated morphologies. Standard semi-quantitative scoring
      approaches, however, are coarse-grained and lack precise neuroanatomic
      localization. We report a proof-of-concept deep learning pipeline that
      identifies specific neuropathologies-amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid
      angiopathy-in immunohistochemically-stained archival slides. Using
      automated segmentation of stained objects and a cloud-based interface, we
      annotate > 70,000 plaque candidates from 43 whole slide images (WSIs) to
      train and evaluate convolutional neural networks. Networks achieve strong
      plaque classification on a 10-WSI hold-out set (0.993 and 0.743 areas
      under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curve,
      respectively). Prediction confidence maps visualize morphology
      distributions at high resolution. Resulting network-derived amyloid beta
      (Abeta)-burden scores correlate well with established semi-quantitative
      scores on a 30-WSI blinded hold-out. Finally, saliency mapping
      demonstrates that networks learn patterns agreeing with accepted
      pathologic features. This scalable means to augment a neuropathologist's
      ability suggests a route to neuropathologic deep phenotyping.

TI  - Comment on "Predicting reaction performance in C-N cross-coupling using
      machine learning".

LID - 10.1126/science.aat8603 [doi]
AB  - Ahneman et al (Reports, 13 April 2018) applied machine learning models to
      predict C-N cross-coupling reaction yields. The models use atomic,
      electronic, and vibrational descriptors as input features. However, the
      experimental design is insufficient to distinguish models trained on
      chemical features from those trained solely on random-valued features in
      retrospective and prospective test scenarios, thus failing classical
      controls in machine learning.

AB  - New machine learning methods to analyze raw chemical and biological data
      are now widely accessible as open-source toolkits. This positions
      researchers to leverage powerful, predictive models in their own domains.
      We caution, however, that the application of machine learning to
      experimental research merits careful consideration. Machine learning
      algorithms readily exploit confounding variables and experimental
      artifacts instead of relevant patterns, leading to overoptimistic
      performance and poor model generalization. In parallel to the strong
      control experiments that remain a cornerstone of experimental research,
      we advance the concept of adversarial controls for scientific machine
      learning: the design of exacting and purposeful experiments to ensure
      that predictive performance arises from meaningful models.

      Approach to Illuminating Key Molecular Pathways in Neuropsychiatric

AB  - Although gene discovery in neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism
      spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and
      Tourette disorder, has accelerated, resulting in a large number of
      molecular clues, it has proven difficult to generate specific hypotheses
      without the corresponding datasets at the protein complex and functional
      pathway level. Here, we describe one path forward-an initiative aimed at
      mapping the physical and genetic interaction networks of these conditions
      and then using these maps to connect the genomic data to neurobiology
      and, ultimately, the clinic. These efforts will include a team of
      geneticists, structural biologists, neurobiologists, systems biologists,
      and clinicians, leveraging a wide array of experimental approaches and
      creating a collaborative infrastructure necessary for long-term
      investigation. This initiative will ultimately intersect with parallel
      studies that focus on other diseases, as there is a significant overlap
      with genes implicated in cancer, infectious disease, and congenital heart
      defects.

AB  - Whereas 400 million distinct compounds are now purchasable within the
      span of a few weeks, the biological activities of most are unknown. To
      facilitate access to new chemistry for biology, we have combined the
      Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) with the maximum Tanimoto similarity
      to the nearest bioactive to predict activity for every commercially
      available molecule in ZINC. This method, which we label SEA+TC,
      outperforms both SEA and a naive-Bayesian classifier via predictive
      performance on a 5-fold cross-validation of ChEMBL's bioactivity data set
      (version 21). Using this method, predictions for over 40% of compounds
      (>160 million) have either high significance (pSEA >/= 40), high
      similarity (ECFP4MaxTc >/= 0.4), or both, for one or more of 1382 targets
      well described by ligands in the literature. Using a further 1347 less-
      well-described targets, we predict activities for an additional 11
      million compounds. To gauge whether these predictions are sensible, we
      investigate 75 predictions for 50 drugs lacking a binding affinity
      annotation in ChEMBL. The 535 million predictions for over 171 million
      compounds at 2629 targets are linked to purchasing information and
      evidence to support each prediction and are freely available via
      https://zinc15.docking.org and https://files.docking.org .

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) chemical protection depends upon discrete
      control of small-molecule access by the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
      Curiously, some drugs cause CNS side-effects despite negligible transit
      past the BBB. To investigate this phenomenon, we asked whether the highly
      BBB-enriched drug efflux transporter MDR1 has dual functions in
      controlling drug and endogenous molecule CNS homeostasis. If this is
      true, then brain-impermeable drugs could induce behavioral changes by
      affecting brain levels of endogenous molecules. Using computational,
      genetic, and pharmacologic approaches across diverse organisms, we
      demonstrate that BBB-localized efflux transporters are critical for
      regulating brain levels of endogenous steroids and steroid-regulated
      behaviors (sleep in Drosophila and anxiety in mice). Furthermore, we show
      that MDR1-interacting drugs are associated with anxiety-related behaviors
      in humans. We propose a general mechanism for common behavioral side
      effects of prescription drugs: pharmacologically challenging BBB efflux
      transporters disrupts brain levels of endogenous substrates and
      implicates the BBB in behavioral regulation.

AB  - Statistical and machine learning approaches predict drug-to-target
      relationships from 2D small-molecule topology patterns. One might expect
      3D information to improve these calculations. Here we apply the logic of
      the extended connectivity fingerprint (ECFP) to develop a rapid,
      alignment-invariant 3D representation of molecular conformers, the
      extended three-dimensional fingerprint (E3FP). By integrating E3FP with
      the similarity ensemble approach (SEA), we achieve higher precision-
      recall performance relative to SEA with ECFP on ChEMBL20 and equivalent
      receiver operating characteristic performance. We identify classes of
      molecules for which E3FP is a better predictor of similarity in
      bioactivity than is ECFP. Finally, we report novel drug-to-target binding
      predictions inaccessible by 2D fingerprints and confirm three of them
      experimentally with ligand efficiencies from 0.442-0.637 kcal/mol/heavy
      atom.

TI  - Zebrafish behavioral profiling identifies multitarget antipsychotic-like
      compounds.
PG  - 559-66
LID - 10.1038/nchembio.2097 [doi]
AB  - Many psychiatric drugs act on multiple targets and therefore require
      screening assays that encompass a wide target space. With sufficiently
      rich phenotyping and a large sampling of compounds, it should be possible
      to identify compounds with desired mechanisms of action on the basis of
      behavioral profiles alone. Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior has
      been used to rapidly identify neuroactive compounds, it is not clear what
      types of behavioral assays would be necessary to identify multitarget
      compounds such as antipsychotics. Here we developed a battery of
      behavioral assays in larval zebrafish to determine whether behavioral
      profiles can provide sufficient phenotypic resolution to identify and
      classify psychiatric drugs. Using the antipsychotic drug haloperidol as a
      test case, we found that behavioral profiles of haloperidol-treated
      zebrafish could be used to identify previously uncharacterized compounds
      with desired antipsychotic-like activities and multitarget mechanisms of
      action.

AB  - Many psychiatric drugs modulate the nervous system through multitarget
      mechanisms. However, systematic identification of multitarget compounds
      has been difficult using traditional in vitro screening assays. New
      approaches to phenotypic profiling in zebrafish can help researchers
      identify novel compounds with complex polypharmacology. For example,
      large-scale behavior-based chemical screens can rapidly identify large
      numbers of structurally diverse and phenotype-related compounds. Once
      these compounds have been identified, a systems-level analysis of their
      structures may help to identify statistically enriched target pathways.
      Together, systematic behavioral profiling and multitarget predictions may
      help researchers identify new behavior-modifying pathways and CNS
      therapeutics.

TI  - Polygenic overlap between schizophrenia risk and antipsychotic response:
      a genomic medicine approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic treatments for schizophrenia do not alleviate
      symptoms for all patients and efficacy is limited by common, often
      severe, side-effects. Genetic studies of disease can identify novel drug
      targets, and drugs for which the mechanism has direct genetic support
      have increased likelihood of clinical success. Large-scale genetic
      studies of schizophrenia have increased the number of genes and gene sets
      associated with risk. We aimed to examine the overlap between
      schizophrenia risk loci and gene targets of a comprehensive set of
      medications to potentially inform and improve treatment of schizophrenia.
      METHODS: We defined schizophrenia risk loci as genomic regions reaching
      genome-wide significance in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
      schizophrenia genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 36 989 cases and
      113 075 controls and loss of function variants observed only once among
      5079 individuals in an exome-sequencing study of 2536 schizophrenia cases
      and 2543 controls (Swedish Schizophrenia Study). Using two large and
      orthogonally created databases, we collated drug targets into 167 gene
      sets targeted by pharmacologically similar drugs and examined enrichment
      of schizophrenia risk loci in these sets. We further linked the exome-
      sequenced data with a national drug registry (the Swedish Prescribed Drug
      Register) to assess the contribution of rare variants to treatment
      response, using clozapine prescription as a proxy for treatment
      resistance. FINDINGS: We combined results from testing rare and common
      variation and, after correction for multiple testing, two gene sets were
      associated with schizophrenia risk: agents against amoebiasis and other
      protozoal diseases (106 genes, p=0.00046, pcorrected =0.024) and
      antipsychotics (347 genes, p=0.00078, pcorrected=0.046). Further analysis
      pointed to antipsychotics as having independent enrichment after removing
      genes that overlapped these two target sets. We noted significant
      enrichment both in known targets of antipsychotics (70 genes, p=0.0078)
      and novel predicted targets (277 genes, p=0.019). Patients with
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia had an excess of rare disruptive
      variants in gene targets of antipsychotics (347 genes, p=0.0067) and in
      genes with evidence for a role in antipsychotic efficacy (91 genes,
      p=0.0029). INTERPRETATION: Our results support genetic overlap between
      schizophrenia pathogenesis and antipsychotic mechanism of action. This
      finding is consistent with treatment efficacy being polygenic and
      suggests that single-target therapeutics might be insufficient. We
      provide evidence of a role for rare functional variants in antipsychotic
      treatment response, pointing to a subset of patients where their genetic
      information could inform treatment. Finally, we present a novel framework
      for identifying treatments from genetic data and improving our
      understanding of therapeutic mechanism. FUNDING: US National Institutes

AB  - Metformin, an established first-line treatment for patients with type 2
      diabetes, has been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects
      that limit its use. Histamine and serotonin have potent effects on the GI
      tract. The effects of metformin on histamine and serotonin uptake were
      evaluated in cell lines overexpressing several amine transporters (OCT1,
      OCT3 and SERT). Metformin inhibited histamine and serotonin uptake by
      OCT1, OCT3 and SERT in a dose-dependent manner, with OCT1-mediated amine
      uptake being most potently inhibited (IC50 = 1.5 mM). A chemoinformatics-
      based method known as Similarity Ensemble Approach predicted diamine
      oxidase (DAO) as an additional intestinal target of metformin, with an
      E-value of 7.4 x 10(-5). Inhibition of DAO was experimentally validated
      using a spectrophotometric assay with putrescine as the substrate. The Ki
      of metformin for DAO was measured to be 8.6 +/- 3.1 mM. In this study, we
      found that metformin inhibited intestinal amine transporters and DAO at
      concentrations that may be achieved in the intestine after therapeutic
      doses. Further studies are warranted to determine the relevance of these
      interactions to the adverse effects of metformin on the gastrointestinal
      tract.

PG  - 151-8
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2 [doi]
AB  - Small molecule drugs are the foundation of modern medical practice, yet
      their use is limited by the onset of unexpected and severe adverse events
      (AEs). Regulatory agencies rely on postmarketing surveillance to monitor
      safety once drugs are approved for clinical use. Despite advances in
      pharmacovigilance methods that address issues of confounding bias,
      clinical data of AEs are inherently noisy. Systems pharmacology-the
      integration of systems biology and chemical genomics-can illuminate drug
      mechanisms of action. We hypothesize that these data can improve drug
      safety surveillance by highlighting drugs with a mechanistic connection
      to the target phenotype (enriching true positives) and filtering those

AB  - Phenotypic screens can identify molecules that are at once penetrant and
      active on the integrated circuitry of a whole cell or organism. These
      advantages are offset by the need to identify the targets underlying the
      phenotypes. Additionally, logistical considerations limit screening for
      certain physiological and behavioral phenotypes to organisms such as
      zebrafish and C. elegans. This further raises the challenge of
      elucidating whether compound-target relationships found in model
      organisms are preserved in humans. To address these challenges we
      searched for compounds that affect feeding behavior in C. elegans and
      sought to identify their molecular mechanisms of action. Here, we applied
      predictive chemoinformatics to small molecules previously identified in a
      C. elegans phenotypic screen likely to be enriched for feeding regulatory
      compounds. Based on the predictions, 16 of these compounds were tested in
      vitro against 20 mammalian targets. Of these, nine were active, with
      affinities ranging from 9 nM to 10 microM. Four of these nine compounds
      were found to alter feeding. We then verified the in vitro findings in
      vivo through genetic knockdowns, the use of previously characterized
      compounds with high affinity for the four targets, and chemical genetic
      epistasis, which is the effect of combined chemical and genetic
      perturbations on a phenotype relative to that of each perturbation in
      isolation. Our findings reveal four previously unrecognized pathways that
      regulate feeding in C. elegans with strong parallels in mammals.
      Together, our study addresses three inherent challenges in phenotypic
      screening: the identification of the molecular targets from a phenotypic
      screen, the confirmation of the in vivo relevance of these targets, and
      the evolutionary conservation and relevance of these targets to their
      human orthologs.

AB  - Discovering the unintended 'off-targets' that predict adverse drug
      reactions is daunting by empirical methods alone. Drugs can act on
      several protein targets, some of which can be unrelated by conventional
      molecular metrics, and hundreds of proteins have been implicated in side
      effects. Here we use a computational strategy to predict the activity of
      656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended 'side-effect' targets. Approximately
      half of the predictions were confirmed, either from proprietary databases
      unknown to the method or by new experimental assays. Affinities for these
      new off-targets ranged from 1 nM to 30 muM. To explore relevance, we
      developed an association metric to prioritize those new off-targets that
      explained side effects better than any known target of a given drug,
      creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network. Among these new
      associations was the prediction that the abdominal pain side effect of
      the synthetic oestrogen chlorotrianisene was mediated through its newly
      discovered inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1. The clinical
      relevance of this inhibition was borne out in whole human blood platelet
      aggregation assays. This approach may have wide application to de-risking
      toxicological liabilities in drug discovery.

AB  - Target identification is a core challenge in chemical genetics. Here we
      use chemical similarity to computationally predict the targets of 586
      compounds that were active in a zebrafish behavioral assay. Among 20
      predictions tested, 11 compounds had activities ranging from 1 nM to
      10,000 nM on the predicted targets. The roles of two of these targets
      were tested in the original zebrafish phenotype. Prediction of targets
      from chemotype is rapid and may be generally applicable.

TI  - The presynaptic component of the serotonergic system is required for
      clozapine's efficacy.
PG  - 638-51
LID - 10.1038/npp.2010.195 [doi]
AB  - Clozapine, by virtue of its absence of extrapyramidal side effects and
      greater efficacy, revolutionized the treatment of schizophrenia, although
      the mechanisms underlying this exceptional activity remain controversial.
      Combining an unbiased cheminformatics and physical screening approach, we
      evaluated clozapine's activity at >2350 distinct molecular targets.
      Clozapine, and the closely related atypical antipsychotic drug
      olanzapine, interacted potently with a unique spectrum of molecular
      targets. This distinct pattern, which was not shared with the typical
      antipsychotic drug haloperidol, suggested that the serotonergic neuronal
      system was a key determinant of clozapine's actions. To test this
      hypothesis, we used pet1(-/-) mice, which are deficient in serotonergic
      presynaptic markers. We discovered that the antipsychotic-like properties
      of the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine were
      abolished in a pharmacological model that mimics NMDA-receptor
      hypofunction in pet1(-/-) mice, whereas haloperidol's efficacy was
      unaffected. These results show that clozapine's ability to normalize
      NMDA-receptor hypofunction, which is characteristic of schizophrenia,
      depends on an intact presynaptic serotonergic neuronal system.

AB  - Molecular biology now dominates pharmacology so thoroughly that it is
      difficult to recall that only a generation ago the field was very
      different. To understand drug action today, we characterize the targets
      through which they act and new drug leads are discovered on the basis of
      target structure and function. Until the mid-1980s the information often
      flowed in reverse: investigators began with organic molecules and sought
      targets, relating receptors not by sequence or structure but by their
      ligands. Recently, investigators have returned to this chemical view of
      biology, bringing to it systematic and quantitative methods of relating
      targets by their ligands. This has allowed the discovery of new targets
      for established drugs, suggested the bases for their side effects, and
      predicted the molecular targets underlying phenotypic screens. The bases
      for these new methods, some of their successes and liabilities, and new
      opportunities for their use are described.

AB  - Virtual and high-throughput screens (HTS) should have complementary
      strengths and weaknesses, but studies that prospectively and
      comprehensively compare them are rare. We undertook a parallel docking
      and HTS screen of 197861 compounds against cruzain, a thiol protease
      target for Chagas disease, looking for reversible, competitive
      inhibitors. On workup, 99% of the hits were eliminated as false
      positives, yielding 146 well-behaved, competitive ligands. These fell
      into five chemotypes: two were prioritized by scoring among the top 0.1%
      of the docking-ranked library, two were prioritized by behavior in the
      HTS and by clustering, and one chemotype was prioritized by both
      approaches. Determination of an inhibitor/cruzain crystal structure and
      comparison of the high-scoring docking hits to experiment illuminated the
      origins of docking false-negatives and false-positives. Prioritizing
      molecules that are both predicted by docking and are HTS-active yields
      well-behaved molecules, relatively unobscured by the false-positives to
      which both techniques are individually prone.

PG  - 2464-71
LID - 10.1021/jm901613f [doi]
AB  - The similarity ensemble approach (SEA) relates proteins based on the set-
      wise chemical similarity among their ligands. It can be used to rapidly
      search large compound databases and to build cross-target similarity
      maps. The emerging maps relate targets in ways that reveal relationships
      one might not recognize based on sequence or structural similarities
      alone. SEA has previously revealed cross talk between drugs acting
      primarily on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here we used SEA to
      look for potential off-target inhibition of the enzyme protein
      farnesyltransferase (PFTase) by commercially available drugs. The
      inhibition of PFTase has profound consequences for oncogenesis, as well
      as a number of other diseases. In the present study, two commercial
      drugs, Loratadine and Miconazole, were identified as potential ligands
      for PFTase and subsequently confirmed as such experimentally. These
      results point toward the applicability of SEA for the prediction of not
      only GPCR-GPCR drug cross talk but also GPCR-enzyme and enzyme-enzyme
      drug cross talk.

TI  - A pilot study of the pharmacodynamic impact of SSRI drug selection and
      beta-1 receptor genotype (ADRB1) on cardiac vital signs in depressed
      patients: a novel pharmacogenetic approach.
PG  - 11-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The adrenergic beta-1 receptor gene (ADRB1) Ser49Gly and
      Arg389Gly variants differentially affect blood pressure response to beta-
      blocker therapy. Binding site prediction results for fluoxetine and
      paroxetine in a bioinformatics model estimated that each of these
      particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have high
      receptor affinity as an "Adrenergic (beta) Blocker," which was confirmed
      in vitro. This pilot study was conducted to understand the relationship
      between these "beta-blocking" SSRIs (fluoxetine and paroxetine) and
      cardiac vital signs (systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR)), when subjects are stratified by
      ADRB1 genotype. Previously ascertained DNA and clinical data was examined
      from 122 subjects recruited for a cross-sectional study of health and
      well being during SSRI pharmacotherapy. A multivariate linear regression
      analysis was used to determine which variables affected cardiac vital
      signs. There was a significant interaction between Arg389Gly variant
      status and "beta-blocking" SSRIs [p = 0.0353] in relation to SBP.
      Specifically in homozygous Arg389 subjects, those receiving "beta-
      blocking" SSRIs had significantly lower SBP (mean 104 mmHg) compared to
      the group taking other SSRIs (mean 122 mmHg) [p = 0.0437]. In these same
      homozygous Arg389 subjects, those receiving "beta-blocking" SSRIs also
      had lower HR (mean 60 bpm) compared to the other SSRIs (mean 79 bpm) [p =
      0.00877]. Future prospective studies of this phenomenon are necessary to
      identify all genetic markers that can predict SSRI-associated
      cardiovascular effects that may be related to the SSRI discontinuation
      syndrome and potentially influence pharmacotherapy decisions.

TI  - Predicting new molecular targets for known drugs.
PG  - 175-81

AB  - Although drugs are intended to be selective, at least some bind to
      several physiological targets, explaining side effects and efficacy.
      Because many drug-target combinations exist, it would be useful to
      explore possible interactions computationally. Here we compared 3,665 US
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and investigational drugs
      against hundreds of targets, defining each target by its ligands.
      Chemical similarities between drugs and ligand sets predicted thousands
      of unanticipated associations. Thirty were tested experimentally,
      including the antagonism of the beta(1) receptor by the transporter
      inhibitor Prozac, the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)
      transporter by the ion channel drug Vadilex, and antagonism of the
      histamine H(4) receptor by the enzyme inhibitor Rescriptor. Overall, 23
      new drug-target associations were confirmed, five of which were potent
      (<100 nM). The physiological relevance of one, the drug
      N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on serotonergic receptors, was confirmed in
      a knockout mouse. The chemical similarity approach is systematic and
      comprehensive, and may suggest side-effects and new indications for many
      drugs.

TI  - A mapping of drug space from the viewpoint of small molecule metabolism.
PG  - e1000474

AB  - Small molecule drugs target many core metabolic enzymes in humans and
      pathogens, often mimicking endogenous ligands. The effects may be
      therapeutic or toxic, but are frequently unexpected. A large-scale
      mapping of the intersection between drugs and metabolism is needed to
      better guide drug discovery. To map the intersection between drugs and
      metabolism, we have grouped drugs and metabolites by their associated
      targets and enzymes using ligand-based set signatures created to quantify
      their degree of similarity in chemical space. The results reveal the
      chemical space that has been explored for metabolic targets, where
      successful drugs have been found, and what novel territory remains. To
      aid other researchers in their drug discovery efforts, we have created an
      online resource of interactive maps linking drugs to metabolism. These
      maps predict the "effect space" comprising likely target enzymes for each
      of the 246 MDDR drug classes in humans. The online resource also provides
      species-specific interactive drug-metabolism maps for each of the 385
      model organisms and pathogens in the BioCyc database collection. Chemical
      similarity links between drugs and metabolites predict potential
      toxicity, suggest routes of metabolism, and reveal drug polypharmacology.
      The metabolic maps enable interactive navigation of the vast biological
      data on potential metabolic drug targets and the drug chemistry currently
      available to prosecute those targets. Thus, this work provides a large-
      scale approach to ligand-based prediction of drug action in small
      molecule metabolism.

AB  - In lead discovery, libraries of 10(6) molecules are screened for
      biological activity. Given the over 10(60) drug-like molecules thought
      possible, such screens might never succeed. The fact that they do, even
      occasionally, implies a biased selection of library molecules. We have
      developed a method to quantify the bias in screening libraries toward
      biogenic molecules. With this approach, we consider what is missing from
      screening libraries and how they can be optimized.

AB  - Chemically similar drugs often bind biologically diverse protein targets,
      and proteins with similar sequences or structures do not always recognize
      the same ligands. How can we uncover the pharmacological relationships
      among proteins, when drugs may bind them in defiance of bioinformatic
      criteria? Here we consider a technique that quantitatively relates
      proteins based on the chemical similarity of their ligands. Starting with
      tens of thousands of ligands organized into sets for hundreds of drug
      targets, we calculated the similarity among sets using ligand topology.
      We developed a statistical model to rank the resulting scores, which were
      then expressed in minimum spanning trees. We have shown that biologically
      sensible groups of targets emerged from these maps, as well as
      experimentally validated predictions of drug off-target effects.

AB  - The similarity of drug targets is typically measured using sequence or
      structural information. Here, we consider chemo-centric approaches that
      measure target similarity on the basis of their ligands, asking how
      chemoinformatics similarities differ from those derived
      bioinformatically, how stable the ligand networks are to changes in
      chemoinformatics metrics, and which network is the most reliable for
      prediction of pharmacology. We calculated the similarities between
      hundreds of drug targets and their ligands and mapped the relationship
      between them in a formal network. Bioinformatics networks were based on
      the BLAST similarity between sequences, while chemoinformatics networks
      were based on the ligand-set similarities calculated with either the
      Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) or a method derived from Bayesian
      statistics. By multiple criteria, bioinformatics and chemoinformatics
      networks differed substantially, and only occasionally did a high
      sequence similarity correspond to a high ligand-set similarity. In
      contrast, the chemoinformatics networks were stable to the method used to
      calculate the ligand-set similarities and to the chemical representation
      of the ligands. Also, the chemoinformatics networks were more natural and
      more organized, by network theory, than their bioinformatics
      counterparts: ligand-based networks were found to be small-world and
      broad-scale.

AB  - The identification of protein function based on biological information is
      an area of intense research. Here we consider a complementary technique
      that quantitatively groups and relates proteins based on the chemical
      similarity of their ligands. We began with 65,000 ligands annotated into
      sets for hundreds of drug targets. The similarity score between each set
      was calculated using ligand topology. A statistical model was developed
      to rank the significance of the resulting similarity scores, which are
      expressed as a minimum spanning tree to map the sets together. Although
      these maps are connected solely by chemical similarity, biologically
      sensible clusters nevertheless emerged. Links among unexpected targets
      also emerged, among them that methadone, emetine and loperamide (Imodium)
      may antagonize muscarinic M3, alpha2 adrenergic and neurokinin NK2
      receptors, respectively. These predictions were subsequently confirmed
      experimentally. Relating receptors by ligand chemistry organizes biology
      to reveal unexpected relationships that may be assayed using the ligands
      themselves.
