Localized maternal mRNAs play important roles in embryogenesis, e.g. the establishment of embryonic axes and the developmental cell fate specification, in various animal species. In ascidians, a group of maternal mRNAs, called &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs, is localized to a subcellular structure, called the Centrosome-Attracting Body (CAB), which contains the ascidian germ plasm, and is inherited by the germline cells during embryogenesis. Posterior end mark (Pem), a &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs member, represses somatic gene expression in the germline during cleavage stages by inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity. However, the functions of other &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/ PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs members in germline formation are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the functions of two &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs, &lt;i&gt;Popk-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Zf-1&lt;/i&gt;, in transcriptional regulation in the germline cells. We show that Popk-1 contributes to transcriptional quiescence by controlling the size of the CAB and amount of Pem protein translated at the CAB. Our studies also indicated that zygotic expression of a germline gene starts around the onset of gastrulation and that the decrease of Pem protein is necessary and sufficient for the zygotic germline gene expression. Finally, further studies showed that the decrease of the Pem protein level is facilitated by Zf-1. Taken together, we propose that &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs such as Popk-1 and Zf-1 control the protein level of the transcriptional repressor Pem and regulate its transcriptional state in the ascidian germline.</content></content><title>Control of Pem protein level by localized maternal factors for transcriptional regulation in the germline of the ascidian, &amp;lt;i&gt;Halocynthia roretzi&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4c:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kaori Miyaoku, Ayaki Nakamoto, Hiroki Nishida, Gaku Kumano&lt;/p&gt;

To ensure optimal calcium accrual in the fetal skeleton, a substantial rise occurs in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D), but is dependent on sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D). Large longitudinal studies addressing free 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D during pregnancy are scarce. We aimed to assess levels of and relationship between 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and free 25(OH)D during pregnancy; determinants of vitamin D status; and association between vitamin D indices or PTH and pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes mellitus and birthweight). Altogether 855 pregnant Norwegian Caucasian women from Trondheim and Stavanger (latitude 63°N and 58°N) were recruited; 94 were lost to follow-up. The study was originally a randomized controlled trial (2007–2009) with gestational diabetes as primary outcome. Data were collected in second and third trimester. In third trimester, 246 (34%) had vitamin D insufficiency and 52 (7%) deficiency (25(OH)D &amp;lt;50 and &amp;lt;30nmol/L, respectively). During wintertime in third trimester, 61 (47%) from Trondheim and 23 (51%) from Stavanger exhibited vitamin D insufficiency. PTH was elevated in 27 (3.7%). Estimate of change between trimesters was (95% CI): 25(OH)D -1.8 (-2.8 to -0.7) nmol/L, DBP 0.62 (0.57 to 0.66) μmol/L, calculated free 25(OH)D -1.7 (-2.0 to -1.4) pmol/L, PTH 0.81 (0.72 to 0.90) pmol/L, 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D (sub-analysis) 31.4 (CI 24.7 to 38.2) pmol/L. A decrease in 1,25(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D occurred in 45% of those with vitamin D deficiency, and they also exhibited lower levels than women with adequate vitamin D status. No association of vitamin D indices and PTH with pregnancy outcomes was observed. Women in Trondheim displayed lower 25(OH)D levels, despite minor latitudinal differences. Less than one-fifth adhered to the authorities’ vitamin D recommendations. These findings demonstrate that hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among pregnant women living in northern latitudes, especially during the dark season, and there is an unmet need to ensure adequate vitamin D intake.</content></content><title>Alterations in the vitamin D endocrine system during pregnancy: A longitudinal study of 855 healthy Norwegian women</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd83:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miriam K.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a cornerstone in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Yet, prolonged GC use is hampered by deleterious GC-related side effects and the emergence of GC resistance. To tackle and overcome these GC-related problems, the applicability of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators was studied, in search of fewer side-effects and at least equal therapeutic efficacy as classic GCs. Compound A (CpdA) is a prototypical example of such a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator and does not support GR-mediated transactivation. Here, we examined whether the combination of CpdA with the classic GC dexamethasone (Dex) may improve GC responsiveness of MM and ALL cell lines. We find that the combination of Dex and CpdA does not substantially enhance GC-mediated cell killing. In line, several apoptosis hallmarks, such as caspase 3/7 activity, PARP cleavage and the levels of cleaved-caspase 3 remain unchanged upon combining Dex with CpdA. Moreover, we monitor no additional inhibition of cell proliferation and the homologous downregulation of GR is not counteracted by the combination of Dex and CpdA. In addition, CpdA is unable to modulate Dex-liganded GR transactivation and transrepression, yet, Dex-mediated transrepression is also aberrant in these lymphoid cell lines. Together, transrepression-favoring compounds, alone or combined with GCs, do not seem a valid strategy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.</content></content><title>Effect of combining glucocorticoids with Compound A on glucocorticoid receptor responsiveness in lymphoid malignancies</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475062:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dorien Clarisse, Karlien Van Wesemael, Jan Tavernier, Fritz Offner, Ilse M.

The neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is pathologically characterized by the massive influx of immune cells into the central nervous system. This contributes to demyelination and axonal damage which causes symptoms such as motor and cognitive dysfunctions. The migration of leukocytes from the blood vessel is orchestrated by a multitude of factors whose determination is essential in reducing cellular influx in MS patients and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. The here studied enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is present intracellularly, on the cell surface and extracellularly. There it contributes to cellular adhesion and migration via its transamidation activity and possibly by facilitating cellular interaction with the extracellular matrix. Previous data from our group showed reduced motor symptoms and cellular infiltration after using a pharmacological TG2 transamidation activity inhibitor in a rat EAE model. However, it remained elusive if the cross-linking activity of the enzyme resulted in the observed effects. To follow-up, we now characterized two new small molecule TG2 activity inhibitors, BJJF078 and ERW1041E. Both compounds are potent inhibitor of recombinant human and mouse Transglutaminase enzyme activity, mainly TG2 and the close related enzyme TG1.

The neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is pathologically characterized by the massive influx of immune cells into the central nervous system. This contributes to demyelination and axonal damage which causes symptoms such as motor and cognitive dysfunctions. The migration of leukocytes from the blood vessel is orchestrated by a multitude of factors whose determination is essential in reducing cellular influx in MS patients and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. The here studied enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is present intracellularly, on the cell surface and extracellularly. There it contributes to cellular adhesion and migration via its transamidation activity and possibly by facilitating cellular interaction with the extracellular matrix. Previous data from our group showed reduced motor symptoms and cellular infiltration after using a pharmacological TG2 transamidation activity inhibitor in a rat EAE model. However, it remained elusive if the cross-linking activity of the enzyme resulted in the observed effects. To follow-up, we now characterized two new small molecule TG2 activity inhibitors, BJJF078 and ERW1041E. Both compounds are potent inhibitor of recombinant human and mouse Transglutaminase enzyme activity, mainly TG2 and the close related enzyme TG1. In addition they did not affect the binding of TG2 to the extracellular matrix substrate fibronectin, a process via which TG2 promotes cellular adhesion and migration. We found, that ERW1041E but not BJJF078 resulted in reduced EAE disease motor-symptoms while neither caused apparent changes in pathology (cellular influx), Transglutaminase activity or expression of inflammation related markers in the spinal cord, compared to vehicle treated controls. Although we cannot exclude issues on bioavailability and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; efficacy of the used compounds, we hypothesize that extracellular TG1/TG2 activity is of greater importance than (intra-)cellular activity in mouse EAE pathology.</description><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><fingerprint>dbc3200e</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196433</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196433</originId><published>1524603600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196433</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ahammad, I.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/308544v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Myocardial infarction, more commonly known as heart attack, is a huge health problem around the world.

&lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&lt;/i&gt; is endemic to China and is a new fruit tree species with economic and environmental benefits, with potential developmental and utilization applications. We report the first complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;. Its genome is 158,084 bp in size, and the overall GC content is 36.8%. An inverted repeats (IR) of 52,672 bp in size is separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region of 86,374 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 19,038 bp. The chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; contains 131 genes including 90 protein-coding genes, 33 transfer RNA genes, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. The genome has a total 510 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Of these, 306, 149, and 55 were found in the LSC, IR, and SSC regions, respectively. In addition, a comparison of the boundaries of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions of ten other &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species exhibited an overall high degree of sequence similarity, with slight variations in the IR boundary region which included gene deletions, insertions, expansions, and contractions. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; lost the &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRA/SSC border and it has the largest &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRB/SSC border among these &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species, whereas the &lt;i&gt;rps19&lt;/i&gt; gene was inserted at the IRB/LSC junction. Furthermore, phylogenetic reconstruction using 61 conserved coding-protein genes clustered &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Prunus tomentosa&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; provides a rich source of genetic information for studies on &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; taxonomy, phylogeny, and evolution, as well as lays the foundation for further development and utilization of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><title>The chloroplast genome of &amp;lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&amp;lt;/i&gt;: Genomic characterization and phylogenetic analysis</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7708:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaopeng Mu, Pengfei Wang, Junjie Du, Yu Gary Gao, Jiancheng Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

We analyze the model of social interactions with coevolution of the topology and states of the nodes. This model can be interpreted as a model of language change. We propose different rewiring mechanisms and perform numerical simulations for each. Obtained results are compared with the empirical data gathered from two online databases and anthropological study of Solomon Islands. We study the behavior of the number of languages for different system sizes and we find that only local rewiring, i.e. triadic closure, is capable of reproducing results for the empirical data in a qualitative manner. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.</content></content><title>Predicting language diversity with complex networks</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d753:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomasz Raducha, Tomasz Gubiec&lt;/p&gt;

Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.</description><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><fingerprint>ddcc047</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196593</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196593</originId><published>1524862800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196593</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Marco Telford</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/WBKZpi-7xqk/s41598-018-24603-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Whole genome diversity of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 derived from healthy individuals of diverse geographic origin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Whole genome diversity of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 derived from healthy individuals of diverse geographic origin, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24603-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24603-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Whole genome diversity of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 derived from healthy individuals of diverse geographic origin&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/WBKZpi-7xqk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: Whole genome diversity of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 derived from healthy individuals of diverse geographic origin</title><unread>True</unread><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d08b0042:2cbd2b0:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Whole genome diversity of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 derived from healthy individuals of diverse geographic origin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Whole genome diversity of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 derived from healthy individuals of diverse geographic origin, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24603-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24603-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Whole genome diversity of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 derived from healthy individuals of diverse geographic origin&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/WBKZpi-7xqk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523917193282</crawled><fingerprint>6350bf08</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24603-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24603-9</originId><published>1523948400000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24603-9</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1525208400000</updated><author><name>The PLOS ONE Editors</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196886</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Retraction: The Early Stage Formation of PI3K-AMPAR GluR2 Subunit Complex Facilitates the Long Term Neuroprotection Induced by Propofol Post-Conditioning in Rats</title><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196886</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a77:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Editors &lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><fingerprint>87b2e438</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196886</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196886</originId><published>1525208400000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>0.07</engagementRate><engagement>2</engagement><updated>1525726800000</updated><author><name>Maria A.

When core body temperature increases, appetite and food consumption decline. A higher core body temperature can occur during exercise, during exposure to warm environmental temperatures, or during a fever, yet the mechanisms that link relatively warm temperatures to appetite suppression are unknown. A recent study in &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates that neurons in the mouse hypothalamus that express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a neural population well known to suppress food intake, also express a temperature-sensitive ion channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Slight increases in body temperature cause a TRPV1-dependent increase in activity in POMC neurons, which suppresses feeding in mice. Taken together, this study suggests a novel mechanism linking body temperature and food-seeking behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1bk6Jjx1vEo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>POMC neurons in heat: A link between warm temperatures and appetite suppression</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1633bba0164:e03f8c:abeb7260</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria A.

According to the Climatic Variability Hypothesis [CVH], thermal plasticity should be wider in organisms from temperate environments, but is unlikely to occur in tropical latitudes where temperature fluctuations are narrow. In copepods, food availability has been suggested as the main driver of phenotypic variability in adult size if the range of temperature change is less than 14°C. &lt;i&gt;Leptodiaptomus garciai&lt;/i&gt; is a calanoid copepod inhabiting Lake Alchichica, a monomictic, tropical lake in Mexico that experiences regular, narrow temperature fluctuations but wide changes in phytoplankton availability. We investigated whether the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food produce phenotypic variation in the life-history traits of this tropical species. We sampled &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;garciai&lt;/i&gt; throughout a year and measured female size, egg size and number, and hatching success, along with temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The amplitude of the plastic responses was estimated with the Phenotypic Plasticity Index. This index was also computed for a published dataset of 84 copepod populations to look if there is a relationship between the amplitude of the phenotypic plasticity of adult size and seasonal change in temperature. The temperature annual range in Lake Alchichica was 3.2°C, whereas phytoplankton abundance varied 17-fold. A strong pattern of thermal plasticity in egg size and adult female size followed the inverse relationship with temperature commonly observed in temperate environments, although its adaptive value was not demonstrated. Egg number, relative reproductive effort and number of nauplii per female were clearly plastic to food availability, allowing organisms to increase their fitness. When comparing copepod species from different latitudes, we found that the magnitude of thermal plasticity of adult size is not related to the range of temperature variation; furthermore, thermal plasticity exists even in environments of limited temperature variation, where the response is more intense compared to temperate populations.</content></content><title>Phenotypic plasticity of life-history traits of a calanoid copepod in a tropical lake: Is the magnitude of thermal plasticity related to thermal variability?</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4a:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Ortega-Mayagoitia, Osvaldo Hernández-Martínez, Jorge Ciros-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

An important criterion for this selection is the molecular resemblance of available models to the primary disease they represent. While studies are being increasingly conducted to comprehensively compare genomic profiles of cell lines and matched primary tumours, there is no data-driven, robust and user-friendly tool assisting scientists in such selection, by adequately estimating the molecular heterogeneity of a primary disease that is captured by existing models. We developed CELLector: a computational tool implemented in an open source R Shiny application and R package that allows researchers to select the most relevant cancer cell lines in a genomic-guided fashion. CELLector combines methods from graph theory and market basket analysis; it leverages tumour genomics data to explore, rank, and select optimal cell line models in a user-friendly way, enabling scientists to make appropriate and informed choices about model inclusion/exclusion in retrospective analyses and future studies.

An important criterion for this selection is the molecular resemblance of available models to the primary disease they represent. While studies are being increasingly conducted to comprehensively compare genomic profiles of cell lines and matched primary tumours, there is no data-driven, robust and user-friendly tool assisting scientists in such selection, by adequately estimating the molecular heterogeneity of a primary disease that is captured by existing models. We developed CELLector: a computational tool implemented in an open source R Shiny application and R package that allows researchers to select the most relevant cancer cell lines in a genomic-guided fashion. CELLector combines methods from graph theory and market basket analysis; it leverages tumour genomics data to explore, rank, and select optimal cell line models in a user-friendly way, enabling scientists to make appropriate and informed choices about model inclusion/exclusion in retrospective analyses and future studies. Additionally, it allows the selection of models within user-defined contexts, for example, by focusing on genomic alterations occurring in biological pathways of interest or considering only predetermined sub-cohorts of cancer patients. Finally, CELLector identifies combinations of molecular alterations underlying disease subtypes currently lacking representative cell lines, providing guidance for the future development of new cancer models. To demonstrate usefulness and applicability of our tool, we present example case studies, where it is used to select representative cell lines for user-defined populations of colorectal cancer patients of current clinical interest.</description><crawled>1523915602683</crawled><fingerprint>1ad1cd0c</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/16/275032</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275032v2?rss=1</originId><published>1523862000000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275032v2?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Joana Costa-Gouveia</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/2cAwf6pBIME/s41598-018-25177-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25177-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2cAwf6pBIME&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles</title><unread>True</unread><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16349216b81:11b4d48:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25177-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2cAwf6pBIME&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1525940317057</crawled><fingerprint>6a3df55d</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2</originId><published>1525935600000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524171600000</updated><author><name>Ngo Tat Trung</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196081</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ngo Tat Trung, Dang Chieu Duong, Hoang Van Tong, Tran Thi Thu Hien, Phan Quoc Hoan, Mai Hong Bang, Mai Thanh Binh, Thai Doan Ky, Nguyen Lam Tung, Nguyen Tien Thinh, Vu Viet Sang, Le Thi Phuong Thao, C-Thomas Bock, Thirumalaisamy P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are biomarkers for several neoplastic diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a literature search, followed by experimental screening and validation in order to establish a miRNA panel in combination with the assessment of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and to evaluate its performance in HCC diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Expression of miRNAs was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 406 serum samples from 118 Vietnamese patients with hepatitis B (HBV)-related HCC, 69 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 100 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 119 healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Three miRNAs (mir-21, mir-122, mir-192) were expressed differentially among the studied subgroups and positively correlated with AFP levels. The individual miRNAs mir-21, mir-122, mir192 or the triplex miRNA panel showed high diagnostic accuracy for HCC (HCC vs. CHB, AUC = 0.906; HCC vs. CHB+LC, AUC = 0.81; HCC vs. CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.854). When AFP levels were ≤20ng/ml, the triplex miRNA panel still was accurate in distinguishing HCC from the other conditions (CHB, AUC = 0.922; CHB+LC, AUC = 0.836; CHB+LC+HC, AUC = 0.862).

Frailty is a risk factor for disability and mortality, and is more prevalent among African American (AA) elderly than whites. We examine frailty in middle-aged racially and economically diverse adults, and investigate how race, poverty and frailty are associated with mortality. Data were from 2541 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study in Baltimore, Maryland; 35–64 years old at initial assessment (56% women; 58% AA). Frailty was assessed using a modified FRAIL scale of fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness and weight loss, and compared with difficulties in physical functioning and daily activities. Frailty prevalence was calculated across race and age groups, and associations with survival were assessed by Cox Regression. 278 participants were frail (11%); 924 pre-frail (36%); 1339 not frail (53%). For those aged 45–54, a higher proportion of whites (13%) than AAs (8%) were frail; while the proportions were similar for those 55–64 (14%,16%). Frailty was associated with overall survival with an average follow-up of 6.6 years, independent of race, sex and poverty status (HR = 2.30; 95%CI 1.67–3.18). In this sample of economically and racially diverse older adults, the known association of frailty prevalence and age differed across race with whites having higher prevalence at younger ages. Frailty was associated with survival beyond the risk factors of race and poverty status in this middle-aged group. Early recognition of frailty at these younger ages may provide an effective method for preventing or delaying disabilities.</content></content><title>Frailty in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of middle-aged Americans in Baltimore</title><unread>False</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b9:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Felicia R.

The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular and respiratory effects of two volumes of bupivacaine 0.25% (0.2 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—treatment BUP02—and 0.4 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; –treatment BUP04) administered epidurally at the lumbosacral intervertebral space in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane. This experimental prospective randomized crossover design trial used six mixed breed adult dogs, four neutered males and two spayed females. Each dog was anesthetized on three different occasions: the first for isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) measurement, and the following two assigned treatments (BUP02 or BUP04). On the two treatment days, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane at 1.3 MAC during the experiments. Cardiovascular and respiratory measurements were recorded before (T0) and 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the epidural administration of bupivacaine. Comparisons between and within groups were performed by a mixed-model ANOVA and Friedman’s test when appropriate followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test or Dunnet’s test to compare time points within each treatment with T0 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly from 15 to 90 minutes after the administration of BUP02 and from 5 to 60 minutes in BUP04, with lower values in BUP04 than in BUP02 lasting up to 30 minutes after bupivacaine administration. No significant changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were observed in either treatment. Hypoventilation was only detected in BUP04. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial oxygen content decreased after both treatment of bupivacaine with no significant decrease in oxygen delivery. Two dogs in BUP04 developed Horner’s syndrome. The epidural administration of 0.4 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of bupivacaine to dogs in sternal recumbency anesthetized with isoflurane 1.3 MAC caused more cardiovascular and respiratory depression than 0.2 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.</content></content><title>Cardiovascular and respiratory effects of lumbosacral epidural bupivacaine in isoflurane-anesthetized dogs: The effects of two volumes of 0.25% solution</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe32:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Raquel Sartori Gonçalves Dias, João Henrique Neves Soares, Douglas dos Santos e Castro, Maria Alice Kuster de Albuquerque Gress, Marcela Lemos Machado, Pablo E.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Although it has been known for decades that patients with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) have an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, limited data exist on non-invasive imaging-based methods for assessing liver fibrosis such as magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) quantification, and no data exist on 2D-shear wave elastography (2D-SWE). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the applicability of different elastography methods for the assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Fifteen clinically asymptomatic AATD patients (11 homozygous PiZZ, 4 heterozygous PiMZ) and 16 matched healthy volunteers were examined using MRE and ARFI quantification. Additionally, patients were examined with 2D-SWE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A high correlation is evident for the shear wave speed (SWS) determined with different elastography methods in AATD patients: 2D-SWE/MRE, ARFI quantification/2D-SWE, and ARFI quantification/MRE (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = 0.8587, 0.7425, and 0.6914, respectively; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;≤0.0089). Four AATD patients with pathologically increased SWS were consistently identified with all three methods—MRE, ARFI quantification, and 2D-SWE.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The high correlation and consistent identification of patients with pathologically increased SWS using MRE, ARFI quantification, and 2D-SWE suggest that elastography has the potential to become a suitable imaging tool for the assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis.

These promising results provide motivation for further investigation of non-invasive assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis using elastography.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><fingerprint>4409ba0d</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196486</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196486</originId><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196486</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Nataliya Rohr-Udilova</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Xi8w8S7nmEs/s41598-018-24437-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24437-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24437-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Xi8w8S7nmEs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24437-5</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d80dcfbd:399b489:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24437-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24437-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Xi8w8S7nmEs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524043206589</crawled><fingerprint>f32d15f5</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24437-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24437-5</originId><published>1524034800000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523998800000</updated><author><name>Omolola C.

A two-phase feeding study evaluating performance of rainbow trout and comparing luminal and mucosal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) bacterial community compositions when fed two alternative protein diets in two rearing systems was conducted. Alternative protein diets (animal protein and plant protein diets) balanced with crystalline amino acids: lysine, methionine and threonine or unbalanced, were fed to rainbow trout in two separate water systems (recirculating (RR) and flow-through (FF)) for a period of 16 weeks. The four diets, each contained 38% digestible protein and 20% fats, were fed to rainbow trout with an average weight of 12.02 ± 0.61 g, and sorted at 30 fish/tank and 12 tanks per dietary treatment. Phase 1 lasted for 8 weeks after which fish from each tank were randomly divided, with one-half moved to new tanks of the opposing system (i.e. from RR to FF and vice versa). The remaining halves were retained in their initial tank and system, and fed their original diets for another 8 weeks (phase 2). After the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; week, 3 fish/tank were sampled for each of proximate analysis, body indexes and 16S rRNA analysis of GIT microbiota. Fish weight (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0030, P&amp;lt;0.0010) and body fat (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0041, P = 0.0177) were significantly affected by diet, diet quality (balanced or unbalanced) and system, respectively. Feed intake (P = 0.0008) and body energy (P&amp;lt;0.0010) were altered by system. Body indexes were not affected by dietary treatment and water systems. Compositional dissimilarities existed between samples from the rearing water and GIT locations (ANOSIM: (R = 0.29, P = 0.0010), PERMANOVA: R = 0.39, P = 0.0010), but not in dietary samples (ANOSIM: R = 0.004, P = 0.3140, PERMANOVA: R = 0.008, P = 0.4540). Bacteria were predominantly from the phyla &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt;. Their abundance differed with more dissimilarity in the luminal samples (ANOSIM: R = 0.40, P = 0.0010, PERMANOVA: R = 0.56, P = 0.0010) than those from the mucosal intestine (ANOSIM: R = 0.37, P = 0.0010, PERMANOVA: R = 0.41, P = 0.0010). Bacteria generally associated with carbohydrate and certain amino acids metabolism were observed in the mucosal intestine while rearing water appeared to serve as the main route of colonization of &lt;i&gt;Aeromonas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/i&gt; in the rainbow trout.</content></content><title>Water system is a controlling variable modulating bacterial diversity of gastrointestinal tract and performance in rainbow trout</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334415d:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Omolola C.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the nationwide seasonal peaks, risk factors, and utilization of medical resources of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;A Taiwan nationwide birth cohort was extracted from the Birth Certificate Application Database during 2007–2009 and prospectively linked to the National Health Insurance database. We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29–35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001).

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the nationwide seasonal peaks, risk factors, and utilization of medical resources of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;A Taiwan nationwide birth cohort was extracted from the Birth Certificate Application Database during 2007–2009 and prospectively linked to the National Health Insurance database. We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29–35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants without BPD born at &amp;lt; 32 wGA had higher RSVH rate than those born at 33–35 wGA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Overall, 56.4% of RSVH occurred within 9 months of CA.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess the association between perceived social support and induced abortion among young women in Lima, Peru. In addition, prevalence and incidence of induced abortion was estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study enrolling women aged 18–25 years from maternal health centers in Southern Lima, Peru, was conducted. Induced abortion was defined as the difference between the total number of pregnancies ended in abortion and the number of spontaneous abortions; whereas perceived social support was assessed using the DUKE-UNC scale. Prevalence and incidence of induced abortion (per 100 person-years risk) was estimated, and the association of interest was evaluated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. A total of 298 women were enrolled, mean age 21.7 (± 2.2) years. Low levels of social support were found in 43.6% (95%CI 38.0%–49.3%), and 17.4% (95%CI: 13.1%– 21.8%) women reported at least one induced abortion. The incidence of induced abortion was 2.37 (95%CI: 1.81–3.11) per 100 person-years risk. The multivariable model showed evidence of the association between low perceived social support and induced abortion (RR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.14–3.30) after controlling for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was evidence of an association between low perceived social support and induced abortion among women aged 18 to 25 years. Incidence of induced abortion was similar or even greater than rates of countries where abortion is legal. Strategies to increase social support and reduce induced abortion rates are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Association between perceived social support and induced abortion: A study in maternal health centers in Lima, Peru</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7121:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luis E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Weekends off antiretroviral therapy (ART) may help engage HIV-1-infected young people facing lifelong treatment. BREATHER showed short cycle therapy (SCT; 5 days on, 2 days off ART) was non-inferior to continuous therapy (CT) over 48 weeks. Planned follow-up was extended to 144 weeks, maintaining original randomisation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;BREATHER was an open-label, non-inferiority trial. Participants aged 8-24yrs with virological suppression on efavirenz-based first-line ART were randomised 1:1, stratified by age and African/non-African sites, to remain on CT or change to SCT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the proportion of participants with viral rebound (confirmed VL≥50 copies/mL) under intent-to-treat at 48 weeks (primary outcome), and in extended follow-up at 96, 144, and 192 weeks. SCT participants returned to CT following viral rebound, 3 VL blips or discontinuation of efavirenz.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of 199 participants (99 SCT, 100 CT), 97 per arm consented to extended follow-up. Median follow-up was 185.3 weeks (IQR 160.9–216.1). 69 (70%) SCT participants remained on SCT at last follow-up. 105 (53%) were male, baseline median age 14 years (IQR 12–18), median CD4 count 735 cells/μL (IQR 576–968). 16 SCT and 16 CT participants had confirmed VL≥50 copies/mL by the end of extended follow-up (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50–2.00). Estimated difference in percentage with viral rebound (SCT minus CT) by week 144 was 1.9% (90% CI -6.6–10.4; p = 0.72) and was similar in a per-protocol analysis. There were no significant differences between arms in proportions of participants with grade 3/4 adverse events (18 SCT vs 16 CT participants; p = 0.71) or ART-related adverse events (10 vs 12; p = 0.82). 20 versus 8 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 16 SCT versus 4 CT participants, respectively (p = 0.005 comparing proportions between groups; incidence rate ratio 2.49, 95%CI 0.71–8.66, p = 0.15). 75% of SAEs (15 SCT, 6 CT) were hospitalisations for a wide range of conditions. 3 SCT and 6 CT participants switched to second-line ART following viral failure (p = 0.50).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sustainable non-inferiority of virological suppression in young people was shown for SCT versus CT over median 3.6 years. Standard-dose efavirenz-based SCT is a viable option for virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected young people on first-line ART with 3-monthly VL monitoring.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;EudraCT 2009-012947-40ISRCTN 97755073ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01641016&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Weekends-off efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children, adolescents and young adults (BREATHER): Extended follow-up results of a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb9e:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Turkova, Cecilia L.

Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. It can alleviate the damage of heavy metal ions, and other chemical substances, changes in temperature and humidity, oxidative stress in higher plants, and enhance resistance of plants to abiotic stress. The transformation of N-Acetyl-5-hydroxy tryptamin into melatonin requires the involvement of methyltransferase. In this study, a methyltransferase gene &lt;i&gt;ZjOMT&lt;/i&gt; has been cloned from &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. The gene was induced by aluminum (Al) stress in the leaves and roots of &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;, and was up-regulated by 20.86- and 31.18-folds, respectively. The expression of ZjOMT in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increased the content of melatonin by about 8-fold in the recombinant strain compared with that of the empty vector strain. Al resistance test showed that the resistance of recombinant strain BL21-pET32-ZjOMT to Al was significantly higher than that of the empty vector strain BL21-pET32. The survival rate of the recombinant strain expressing ZjOMT was about 100-fold higher than that of the empty vector strain when treated with 0.35 mM Al. These findings suggest that the heterologous expression of ZjOMT improved the resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to Al by increasing the content of melatonin.</content></content><title>Heterologous expression of ZjOMT from &amp;lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&amp;lt;/i&gt; in &amp;lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; confers aluminum resistance through melatonin production</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42262:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongsong Luo, Chunyan He, Liebao Han&lt;/p&gt;

Endothelial dysfunction is one of the main pathological changes in Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway is associated with endothelial dysfunction. However, the interaction between ROCK and nuclear factor of activated T cells isoform c3 (NFATc3) in the development of this pathological response under chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is unclear. To simulate the OSA model, we established a moderate CIH rat model by administering the fraction of inspired O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from 21% to 9%, 20 times/h, 8 h/day for 3 weeks. Fasudil (ROCK inhibitor, 8 mg/kg/d, i.p.) was administrated in the rats exposed to CIH for 3 weeks. Our results demonstrated that CIH caused significantly endothelial dysfunction, accompanying with increased ET-1 level, decreased eNOS expression and NO production, which reduced ACh-induced vascular relaxation responses. Moreover, RhoA/ROCK-2/NFATc3 expressions were up-regulated. Fasudil significantly improved CIH induced endothelial dysfunction. Data suggested that the ROCK activation is necessary for endothelial dysfunction during CIH.</content></content><title>Fasudil improves endothelial dysfunction in rats exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia through RhoA/ROCK/NFATc3 pathway</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd95:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jie-Ru Li, Ya-Shuo Zhao, Yue Chang, Sheng-Chang Yang, Ya-Jing Guo, En-Sheng Ji&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Several patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking. Stride-to-stride variability of temporal gait parameters was also estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Walking speed, cadence or stride length were not different between PD and HS during linear walking. Speed, cadence and stride length diminished during curved walking in both groups, stride length more in PD than HS. In PD compared to HS, the stride length-cadence relationship was altered during curved walking. Duration of the double-support phase was also increased during curved walking, as was variability of the single support, swing phase and double support phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The spatio-temporal gait pattern and variability are significantly modified in well-treated, high-functioning patients with PD walking along circular trajectories, even when they exhibit no changes in speed in straight-line walking. The increased variability of the gait phases during curved walking is an identifying characteristic of PD.

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular method for measuring transcript abundance. The most commonly used method of interpretation is relative quantification and thus necessitates the use of normalization controls (i.e. reference genes) to standardize transcript abundance. The most popular gene targets for RT-qPCR are housekeeping genes because they are thought to maintain a static transcript level among a variety of samples. However, more recent studies have shown, several housekeeping genes are not reliably stable. This is the first study to examine the potential of several reference genes for use in RT-qPCR normalization during barley malting. The process of malting barley mechanizes the imbibition and subsequent germination of barley seeds under controlled conditions. Malt quality is controlled by many pleiotropic genes that are determined by examining the result of physiological changes the barley seed undergoes during the malting process. We compared the stability of 13 reference genes across both two-and six-row malting barleys (Conrad and Legacy, respectfully) throughout the entirety of the malting process. Initially, primer target specificity, amplification efficiency and average Ct values were determined for each of the selected primer pairs. Three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to rank the stability of each reference gene. Rankings were similar between the two- and six-row with the exception of BestKeeper’s ranking of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;). A consensus ranking among programs was determined using RefFinder. Our results show that Actin (A&lt;i&gt;CT&lt;/i&gt;) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (&lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) were the most stable throughout micromalting, while &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and Cyclophilin (&lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) were the least stable. Two reference genes are necessary for stable transcript normalization according to geNorm and the best two reference genes (&lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) provided a sufficient level of stability.</content></content><title>Evaluation and selection of internal reference genes from two- and six-row U.S. malting barley varieties throughout micromalting for use in RT-qPCR</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505c:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jason G.

The relationship between body height and the risk of non‒communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer has been the subject of much debate in the epidemiological literature. Concerns have recently arisen over spurious associations due to confounding factors like birth cohort, especially in the context of epidemiological transition. The population of Sardinia represents an interesting case study, as the average physical stature of inhabitants was the lowest recorded in Europe until a few decades ago. In this population we tested whether height is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cancer. We analysed the stature of 10,427 patients undergoing endoscopy for any reason, for whom a detailed clinical history of cardiovascular disease and/or malignancies had been documented. Poisson regression modelling was used to test the association between stature and disease risk. When patients were subdivided according to sex and height tertiles, the risk of cardiovascular disease proved significantly greater for subjects in the lowest tertile irrespective of sex (men: 1.87; 95%CI 1.41‒2.47; women: 1.23; 95%CI 0.92‒1.66) and smaller for those in the highest tertile (men: 0.51; 95%CI 0.35‒0.75; women: 0.41; 95%CI 0.27‒0.61). However, after adjusting the risk for birth cohort and established risk factors, it mostly resulted in non-significant values, although the overall trend persisted. Similar results were obtained for all-cancer risk (relative risk for men and women in the lowest tertile: 1.44; 95%CI 1.09–1.90 and 1.17; 95%CI 0.93–1.48, in the highest tertile: 0.51; 95%CI 0.36–0.72 and 0.62; 95%CI 0.47–0.81, respectively) as well as for some of the most common types of cancer. We concluded that the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and malignancies does not vary significantly with stature in the Sardinian population, after adjusting for birth cohort and more obvious risk factors.</content></content><title>The association of adult height with the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in the population of Sardinia</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7eb:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Giovanni Mario Pes, Antonello Ganau, Eugenia Tognotti, Alessandra Errigo, Chiara Rocchi, Maria Pina Dore&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a live, viral vaccine under advanced development as a non-replicating smallpox vaccine. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted to demonstrate the humoral immunogenic equivalence of three consecutively manufactured MVA production lots, and to confirm the safety and tolerability of MVA focusing on cardiac readouts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The trial was conducted at 34 sites in the US. Vaccinia-naïve adults aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups using a 1:1:1:1 randomization scheme. Subjects received either two MVA injections from three consecutive lots (Groups 1-3), or two placebo injections (Group 4), four weeks apart. Everyone except personnel involved in vaccine handling and administration was blinded to treatment. Safety assessment focused on cardiac monitoring throughout the trial. Vaccinia-specific antibody titers were measured using a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) and an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The primary immunogenicity endpoint was Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after two MVA vaccinations measured by PRNT at trial visit 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01144637.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 2013 and May 2014, 4005 subjects were enrolled and received at least one injection of MVA (n = 3003) or placebo (n = 1002). The three MVA lots induced equivalent antibody titers two weeks after the second vaccination, with seroconversion rates of 99·8% (PRNT) and 99·7% (ELISA). Overall, 180 (6·0%) subjects receiving MVA and 29 (2·9%) subjects in the placebo group reported at least one unsolicited Adverse Event (AE) that was considered trial-related. Vaccination was well tolerated without significant safety concerns, particularly regarding cardiac assessment.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The neutralizing and total antibody titers induced by each of the three lots were equivalent. No significant safety concerns emerged in this healthy trial population, especially regarding cardiac safety, thus confirming the excellent safety and tolerability profile of MVA.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01144637&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Immunogenicity and safety of three consecutive production lots of the non replicating smallpox vaccine MVA: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled phase III trial</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793636:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edgar Turner Overton, Steven J.

Motor tics are sudden, repetitive, involuntary movements representing the hallmark behaviors of the neurodevelopmental disease Tourette’s syndrome (TS). The primary cause of TS remains unclear. The initial observation that dopaminergic antagonists alleviate tics led to the development of a dopaminergic theory of TS etiology which is supported by &lt;i&gt;post mortem&lt;/i&gt; and in vivo studies indicating that non-physiological activation of the striatum could generate tics. The striatum controls movement execution through the balanced activity of dopamine receptor D1 and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons of the direct and indirect pathway, respectively. Different neurotransmitters can activate or repress striatal activity and among them, dopamine plays a major role. In this study we introduced a chronic dopaminergic alteration in juvenile rats, in order to modify the delicate balance between direct and indirect pathway. This manipulation was done in the dorsal striatum, that had been associated with tic-like movements generation in animal models. The results were movements resembling tics, which were categorized and scored according to a newly developed rating scale and were reduced by clonidine and riluzole treatment. Finally, &lt;i&gt;post mortem&lt;/i&gt; analyses revealed altered RNA expression of dopaminergic receptors D1 and D2, suggesting an imbalanced dopaminergic regulation of medium spiny neuron activity as being causally related to the observed phenotype.</content></content><title>Altered dopaminergic regulation of the dorsal striatum is able to induce tic-like movements in juvenile rats</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae77:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ester Nespoli, Francesca Rizzo, Tobias Boeckers, Ulrike Schulze, Bastian Hengerer&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, &lt;i&gt;post mortem&lt;/i&gt; analyses revealed altered RNA expression of dopaminergic receptors D1 and D2, suggesting an imbalanced dopaminergic regulation of medium spiny neuron activity as being causally related to the observed phenotype.</description><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><fingerprint>20889c29</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</originId><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196515</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>23</engagement><author><name>Neubert, N.

The best predictor of IA was AspICU algorithm (AUC, 1) followed by serum galactomannan antigen (GM) cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.822). For 37% of patients, IA diagnoses was made earlier with serum GM than radiology.

The incidence of cancers attributable to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) that affect males is on the rise. Currently in the UK teenage boys are not vaccinated against HPV while teenage girls are. The rationale for not vaccinating boys is that vaccinating girls should provide herd immunity to boys, however this does not protect men who have sex with men or men who have sex with unvaccinated women. The issue of whether to vaccinate boys or not is a controversial one with considerable lobbying taking place to change the existing policy. On one side of the debate are financial considerations while on the other side health equality is important. One avenue that has not been presented is the parental perspective. The current study uses a self-report questionnaire to explore what parents of teenage boys know about HPV and the vaccine and whether they want the vaccine for their sons. Only half of the parents had heard of HPV prior to completing the survey. Of those who had heard of HPV, knowledge about the health sequelae of HPV for men was poor relative to their knowledge about its impact on female health. Parents who would be willing to vaccinate their sons had higher levels of knowledge about HPV than those parents who would be unwilling or unsure. Irrespective of whether they had previously heard of HPV or not, once provided with a brief description of HPV, the majority of parents thought that boys should be offered the vaccination. There is a pressing need for public education about the potential impact of HPV on male health in order to facilitate uptake of the vaccine in the event of the vaccination programme being extended to men or to facilitate informed decision making about seeking the vaccine privately in the event that it isn’t.</content></content><title>Attitudes towards and knowledge about Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and the HPV vaccination in parents of teenage boys in the UK</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d7:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susan Mary Sherman, Emma Nailer&lt;/p&gt;

We anticipate that this method will expedite access to enantioenriched small-molecule building blocks bearing versatile basic heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524766155374</crawled><fingerprint>62ef0646</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/419.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><published>1524764252000</published><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/419?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/419?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Matt Bumstead</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/UTgqjhIlLJY/s41598-018-24171-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: disLocate: tools to rapidly quantify local intermolecular structure to assess two-dimensional order in self-assembled systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: disLocate: tools to rapidly quantify local intermolecular structure to assess two-dimensional order in self-assembled systems, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24171-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24171-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: disLocate: tools to rapidly quantify local intermolecular structure to assess two-dimensional order in self-assembled systems&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/UTgqjhIlLJY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: disLocate: tools to rapidly quantify local intermolecular structure to assess two-dimensional order in self-assembled systems</title><unread>True</unread><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162cda398f0:2887001:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: disLocate: tools to rapidly quantify local intermolecular structure to assess two-dimensional order in self-assembled systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: disLocate: tools to rapidly quantify local intermolecular structure to assess two-dimensional order in self-assembled systems, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24171-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24171-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: disLocate: tools to rapidly quantify local intermolecular structure to assess two-dimensional order in self-assembled systems&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/UTgqjhIlLJY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523868473584</crawled><fingerprint>6328a663</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24171-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24171-y</originId><published>1523862000000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24171-y</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01714/20180507/images/medium/jm-2017-01714a_0017.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01714&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Genetic diversity and structure of populations at the edge of the species’ spatial distribution are important for potential adaptation to environmental changes and consequently, for the long-term survival of the species. Here, we combined classical population genetic methods with newly developed network analyses to gain complementary insights into the genetic structure and diversity of &lt;i&gt;Acacia tortilis&lt;/i&gt;, a keystone desert tree, at the northern edge of its global distribution, where the population is under threat from climatic, ecological, and anthropogenic changes. We sampled &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tortilis&lt;/i&gt; from 14 sites along the Dead Sea region and the Arava Valley in Israel and in Jordan. In addition, we obtained samples from Egypt and Sudan, the hypothesized origin of the species. Samples from all sites were genotyped using six polymorphic microsatellite loci.Our results indicate a significant genetic structure in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tortilis&lt;/i&gt; along the Arava Valley. This was detected at different hierarchical levels—from the basic unit of the subpopulation, corresponding to groups of trees within ephemeral rivers (wadis), to groups of subpopulations (&lt;i&gt;communities&lt;/i&gt;) that are genetically more connected relative to others. The latter structure mostly corresponds to the partition of the major drainage basins in the area. Network analyses, combined with classical methods, allowed for the identification of key &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tortilis&lt;/i&gt; subpopulations in this region, characterized by their relatively high level of genetic diversity and centrality in maintaining gene flow in the population. Characterizing such key subpopulations may enable conservation managers to focus their efforts on certain subpopulations that might be particularly important for the population’s long-term persistence, thus contributing to species conservation within its peripheral range.</content></content><title>Detecting hierarchical levels of connectivity in a population of &amp;lt;i&gt;Acacia tortilis&amp;lt;/i&gt; at the northern edge of the species’ global distribution: Combining classical population genetics and network analyses</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc712e:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yael S.

The development of such an aligner, called FAMOUS (Fast Approximate string Matching using OptimUm search Schemes), is ongoing as our future work.</description><crawled>1523650717087</crawled><fingerprint>41ce6ee9</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/13/301085</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301085v1?rss=1</originId><published>1523602800000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301085v1?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524776400000</updated><author><name>Chen-Yu Lee</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196789</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chen-Yu Lee, Hui-Jun Lin, Kotapati Kasi Viswanath, Chih-Peng Lin, Bill Chia-Han Chang, Pei-Hsun Chiu, Chan-Tai Chiu, Ren-Huang Wang, Shih-Wen Chin, Fure-Chyi Chen&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Correction: The development of functional mapping by three sex-related loci on the third whorl of different sex types of &amp;lt;i&gt;Carica papaya&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.</title><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196789</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae85:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chen-Yu Lee, Hui-Jun Lin, Kotapati Kasi Viswanath, Chih-Peng Lin, Bill Chia-Han Chang, Pei-Hsun Chiu, Chan-Tai Chiu, Ren-Huang Wang, Shih-Wen Chin, Fure-Chyi Chen&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><fingerprint>52f043b5</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196789</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196789</originId><published>1524776400000</published><visual><contentType>image/png</contentType><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196789.t001</url><width>320</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>103</height></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Hongxu Ding</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/kt8OlXEgzk4/s41467-018-03843-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantitative assessment of protein activity in orphan tissues and single cells using the metaVIPER algorithm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantitative assessment of protein activity in orphan tissues and single cells using the metaVIPER algorithm, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03843-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03843-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;VIPER has been successfully used to assess the regulatory activities of proteins from gene expression data, but its dependence on tissue-specific molecular profiles limits its applicability.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD) is a dilatative arteriopathy associated with intracerebral hemorrhage. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the frequency and anatomical distribution of cerebral microbleeds (cMBs) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in VBD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From a MRI database 94 VBD patients were identified and analyzed with special emphasis on cMBs and ICH on T2*-weighted gradient echo images (GRE) in relation to the established diagnostic MRI criteria of VBD (diameter, height, and lateral position). cMBs/ICH location was categorized into anterior/posterior circulation. Clinical information like demographic details, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities were abstracted from the case records. An extensive modelling approach using generalized linear mixed-effects models was used.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 79 (84.0%) patients (mean age 72.1±10.0 years, 74.7% male) with a standard stroke MRI protocol including T2*-weighted images were included in the analysis. cMBs were observed in 38/79 (48.1%) patients, ranging from 1 to 84 cMBs per patient. In the posterior circulation cMBs were observed more frequently (34/38 (89.5%)) in comparison to the anterior circulation (24/38 (63.2%)). cMBs were observed in the thalamus in 20/38 (52.6%), hippocampus in 1/38 (2.6%), occipital lobe in 18/38 (47.4%), pons in 6/38 (15.8%), medulla oblongata in 2/38 (5.2%), and cerebellum in 14/38 (36.8%) patients. ICH was observed in only 6/79 (7.6%) patients. There were significantly more cMBs in the posterior- (NCMBs-PC = 1.717, 95%CI: 1.336–2.208, p = 0.0315) than in the anterior circulation.Logistic regression model showed a significant positive effect of clinical symptoms such as ischemic, TIA and hemorrhagic stroke on the presence of cMBs (OR = 3.34, 95%CI [2.0–5.57], p = 0.0184; ndf = 78, AIC = 107.51).General linear model showed that clinical symptoms have a highly significant effect on the number of cMBs (N = 2.78, 95%CI [2.51–3.07], p&amp;lt;2*10–16; ndf = 78, AIC = 1218).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;cMBs and ICH may be observed in the anterior and posterior circulation in VBD but they occur more frequently in the posterior circulation. Most common anatomical locations of cMBs in VBD were the thalamus, occipital lobe and cerebellum. This posterior dominance of cMBs and ICH in VBD might reflect a specific underlying vascular pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Anatomical distribution of cerebral microbleeds and intracerebral hemorrhage in vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935cc:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alex Förster, Ralf Wenz, Máté Elöd Maros, Johannes Böhme, Mansour Al-Zghloul, Angelika Alonso, Christoph Groden, Holger Wenz&lt;/p&gt;

A model in which stimuli become consciously reportable when they elicit a nonlinear ignition process in higher cortical areas explained our results.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><fingerprint>c7bc698f</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/537.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><published>1525369184000</published><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/537?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/537?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Rekha Bhar</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/33nGrr2uYtU/s41598-018-24821-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploring drying pattern of a sessile droplet of genomic DNA in the presence of hematite nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring drying pattern of a sessile droplet of genomic DNA in the presence of hematite nanoparticles, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24821-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24821-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Exploring drying pattern of a sessile droplet of genomic DNA in the presence of hematite nanoparticles&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/33nGrr2uYtU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Exploring drying pattern of a sessile droplet of genomic DNA in the presence of hematite nanoparticles</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24821-1</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162e25a1937:4987d39:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploring drying pattern of a sessile droplet of genomic DNA in the presence of hematite nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring drying pattern of a sessile droplet of genomic DNA in the presence of hematite nanoparticles, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24821-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24821-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Exploring drying pattern of a sessile droplet of genomic DNA in the presence of hematite nanoparticles&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/33nGrr2uYtU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524215978295</crawled><fingerprint>e03cff19</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24821-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24821-1</originId><published>1524207600000</published><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24821-1/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24821_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>316</height></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523912400000</updated><author><name>Joydeep Sarkar</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/mfiym6I-5Rs/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joydeep Sarkar, Alka A.

Iron plays vital roles in the human body including enzymatic processes, oxygen-transport via hemoglobin and immune response. Iron metabolism is characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron dextran. This &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical experiments. Such an approach could pave the way for development of effective personalized treatment of CKD anemia.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mfiym6I-5Rs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Whole-body iron transport and metabolism: Mechanistic, multi-scale model to improve treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14cf:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joydeep Sarkar, Alka A.

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</content></content><title>“Yes, we know!” (Over)confidence in general knowledge among Austrian entrepreneurs</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506b:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that quantifies the magnetic susceptibility distribution within biological tissues. QSM calculates the underlying magnetic susceptibility by deconvolving the tissue magnetic field map with a unit dipole kernel. However, this deconvolution problem is ill-posed. The morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) introduces total variation (TV) to regularize the susceptibility reconstruction. However, MEDI results still contain artifacts near tissue boundaries because MEDI only imposes TV constraint on voxels inside smooth regions. We introduce a Morphology-Adaptive TV (MATV) for improving TV-regularized QSM. The MATV method first classifies imaging target into smooth and nonsmooth regions by thresholding magnitude gradients. In the dipole inversion for QSM, the TV regularization weights are a monotonically decreasing function of magnitude gradients. Thus, voxels inside smooth regions are assigned with larger weights than those in nonsmooth regions. Using phantom and in vivo datasets, we compared the performance of MATV with that of MEDI. MATV results had better visual quality than MEDI results, especially near tissue boundaries. Preliminary brain imaging results illustrated that MATV has potential to improve the reconstruction of regions near tissue boundaries.</content></content><title>Morphology-adaptive total variation for the reconstruction of quantitative susceptibility map from the magnetic resonance imaging phase</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475055:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Li Guo, Yingjie Mei, Jijing Guan, Xiangliang Tan, Yikai Xu, Wufan Chen, Qianjin Feng, Yanqiu Feng&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to investigate whether there was any difference in eating pattern, abnormal eating behaviour, obesity and the number of food addiction symptoms according to food addiction presence. A total sample of 851 healthy subjects living in Ankara (n = 360 male, n = 491 female) aged 19–65 years were included in this cross-sectional survey. Data on demographic information, 24-hour dietary recalls, Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), and anthropometric measurements were collected through face-to-face interviews. Overall, 11.4% of participants were identified as “food addicted” (F: 13.0%; M: 9.2%). Subjects meeting criteria for ‘food addiction&apos; had higher body mass index (35.1% were obese and 3.1% were underweight), compared to subjects without food addiction (13.1% were obese and 10.2% were underweight) (p&amp;lt;0.05). Abnormal eating attitudes estimated with EAT-26 were determined as 45.5% in males, 37.5% in females and 40.2% in total, among subjects with food addiction. Daily energy, protein and fat intakes were significantly higher in food addicted females, compared to non-addicted females (p&amp;lt;0.05). Participants with food addiction reported significantly more problems with foods, which contain high amounts of fat and sugar, compared to the participants without food addiction. Food addiction behaviour should be considered as a part of efforts towards reducing food related problems involving obesity.</content></content><title>How does food addiction influence dietary intake profile?</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f5:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aylin Ayaz, Reyhan Nergiz-Unal, Damla Dedebayraktar, Asli Akyol, A.

During hemolysis, hemoglobin and heme released from red blood cells promote oxidative stress, inflammation and thrombosis. Plasma haptoglobin and hemopexin scavenge free hemoglobin and heme, respectively, but can be depleted in hemolytic states. Haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation protect tissues, including the vasculature, liver and kidneys. It is widely assumed that these protective effects are due primarily to hemoglobin and heme clearance from the vasculature. However, this simple assumption does not account for the consequent cytoprotective adaptation seen in cells and organs. To further address the mechanism, we used a hyperhemolytic murine model (Townes-SS) of sickle cell disease to examine cellular responses to haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation. A single infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin (± equimolar hemoglobin) in SS-mice increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the liver, kidney and skin several fold within 1 hour and decreased nuclear NF-ĸB phospho-p65, and vaso-occlusion for 48 hours after infusion. Plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were not significantly changed 1 hour after infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin. Haptoglobin and hemopexin also inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation and lipopolysaccharide-induced vaso-occlusion in SS-mice. Inhibition of HO-1 activity with tin protoporphyrin blocked the protections afforded by haptoglobin and hemopexin in SS-mice. The HO-1 reaction product carbon monoxide, fully restored the protection, in part by inhibiting Weibel-Palade body mobilization of P-selectin and von Willebrand factor to endothelial cell surfaces. Thus, the mechanism by which haptoglobin and hemopexin supplementation in hyperhemolytic SS-mice induces cytoprotective cellular responses is linked to increased HO-1 activity.</content></content><title>Haptoglobin and hemopexin inhibit vaso-occlusion and inflammation in murine sickle cell disease: Role of heme oxygenase-1 induction</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67c4:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by John D.

State-of-the-art light-sheet and confocal microscopes allow recording of entire embryos in 3D and over time (3D+t) for many hours. Fluorescently labeled structures can be segmented and tracked automatically in these terabyte-scale 3D+t images, resulting in thousands of cell migration trajectories that provide detailed insights to large-scale tissue reorganization at the cellular level. Here we present EmbryoMiner, a new interactive open-source framework suitable for in-depth analyses and comparisons of entire embryos, including an extensive set of trajectory features. Starting at the whole-embryo level, the framework can be used to iteratively focus on a region of interest within the embryo, to investigate and test specific trajectory-based hypotheses and to extract quantitative features from the isolated trajectories. Thus, the new framework provides a valuable new way to quantitatively compare corresponding anatomical regions in different embryos that were manually selected based on biological prior knowledge. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 3D+t light-sheet microscopy images of zebrafish embryos, showcasing potential user applications that can be performed using the new framework.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fPwmNSZz3xw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>EmbryoMiner: A new framework for interactive knowledge discovery in large-scale cell tracking data of developing embryos</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162df187f34:50ab7:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schott, Manuel Traub, Cornelia Schlagenhauf, Masanari Takamiya, Thomas Antritter, Andreas Bartschat, Katharina Löffler, Denis Blessing, Jens C.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with inflammation. We tried to investigate the influence of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and tocilizumab (TCZ) on the glucose metabolism of RA patients. RA patients in whom treatment with TNFi or TCZ was initiated from 2008 to 2015 were studied based on their medical records. We analyzed patients whose glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured both before and 3 months after the initiation of these biologic agents. The association between HbA1c reduction and the treatment was evaluated. From 971 cases treated with these biologic agents, 221 cases whose medical records of HbA1c were available, were included (TNFi, n = 154; TCZ, n = 67). Both the TNFi and TCZ groups had significantly lower HbA1c values at 1 month and 3 months after the initiation of treatment (TNFi, p&amp;lt;0.001; TCZ, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although the pretreatment HbA1c values did not differ (TNFi, 6.2%; TCZ, 6.2%; p = 0.532), the 3-month treatment HbA1c values were lower (TNFi, 6.1%; TCZ, 5.8%; p = 0.010) and the changes in HbA1c (ΔHbA1c) were greater (TNFi, 0.1%; TCZ, 0.4%; p&amp;lt;0.001) in the TCZ group. The reduction of HbA1c—defined by the achievement of a ΔHbA1c of ≥0.5%—was associated with baseline diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, baseline diabetes treatment, hospitalization, medical change during the observation period, and TCZ. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, TCZ was associated with the reduction of HbA1c in comparison to TNFi (adjusted OR = 5.59, 95% CI = 2.56–12.2; p&amp;lt;0.001). The HbA1c levels in RA patients were significantly lower after the initiation of TNFi or TCZ. Our study suggests that TCZ decreases the HbA1c levels in RA patients to a greater extent than TNFi.</content></content><title>Effects of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and tocilizumab on the glycosylated hemoglobin levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; an observational study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67bf:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yukimi Otsuka, Chikako Kiyohara, Yusuke Kashiwado, Takuya Sawabe, Shuji Nagano, Yasutaka Kimoto, Masahiro Ayano, Hiroki Mitoma, Mitsuteru Akahoshi, Yojiro Arinobu, Hiroaki Niiro, Koichi Akashi, Takahiko Horiuchi&lt;/p&gt;

Vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), a food additive with rich milk flavor, is commonly used in the food, beverage and cosmetic industries. However, excessive consumption of vanillin may cause liver and kidney damage. Therefore, methods for detecting and controlling the level of vanillin in food, especially in infant powder, have important practical significance. In this study, we established a colorimetric assay for vanillin detection. The detection was performed under high-temperature and acidic conditions, which can induce the reaction of the aldehyde group of vanillin with the amino group of o-toluidine. The resulting product had a maximum absorption at 363 nm, which was quantified by a UV spectrophotometer. This assay had a limit of detection (&lt;i&gt;LOD&lt;/i&gt;) of 1 pg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and a linear range between 1 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 100 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The average recoveries at three spiked levels were in the range from 91.1% to 101.6% with a relative standard deviation (&lt;i&gt;RSD&lt;/i&gt;) of 4.62% ~ 7.27%.</content></content><title>A colorimetric assay for vanillin detection by determination of the luminescence of o-toluidine condensates</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7ed:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jin Zhao, Haixiong Xia, Tingyu Yu, Lu Jin, Xuehua Li, Yinghui Zhang, Liping Shu, Lingwen Zeng, Zhixu He&lt;/p&gt;

The average recoveries at three spiked levels were in the range from 91.1% to 101.6% with a relative standard deviation (&lt;i&gt;RSD&lt;/i&gt;) of 4.62% ~ 7.27%.</description><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><fingerprint>f5e02dda</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194010</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194010</originId><published>1524258000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194010</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Kanav Setia</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019371?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Bravyi-Kitaev Superfast simulation of electronic structure on a quantum computer</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019371?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1630b2b1723:100d5e6:fc1f8953</id><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1524900763427</crawled><fingerprint>c7252096</fingerprint><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019371?af=R</originId><published>1524635335000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Eduardo Zavala</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/9GcXPJT7d40/s41598-018-24595-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Selection of reference genes for microRNA analysis associated to early stress response to handling and confinement in &lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Selection of reference genes for microRNA analysis associated to early stress response to handling and confinement in &amp;lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 16 April 2018;

Providing this type of reproducibility, however, is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally come in various versions.

As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines for the analysis of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Bisulfite-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq. All pipelines process raw experimental data, and generate reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise beyond the use of the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own data sets or bioinformaticians seeking to automate all, or parts of, their analyses.

Methods &lt;p&gt;Twenty healthy subjects (10 males, age 28±5 years [mean ± SD]) lay supine, awake, with the head in a neutral position. Ventilation was monitored with inductance bands. Real-time B-mode ultrasound movies were analysed. We measured genioglossus motion (i) during spontaneous breathing, voluntary targeted breathing (normal tidal volume Vt), and voluntary hyperpnoea (at 1.5Vt and 2 Vt); (ii) during inspiratory flow resistive loading; (iii) with changes in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Average peak inspiratory displacement of the infero-posterior region of genioglossus was 0.89±0.56 mm; 1.02±0.88 mm; 1.27±0.70 mm respectively for voluntary Vt, and during voluntary hyperpnoea at 1.5Vt and 2Vt. A change in genioglossus motion was observed with increased Vt. During increasing inspiratory resistive loading, the genioglossus displaced less anteriorly (p = 0.005) but more inferiorly (p = 0.027). When lung volume was altered, no significant changes in genioglossus movement were observed (p = 0.115).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In healthy subjects, we observed non-uniform heterogeneous inspiratory motion within the inferoposterior part of genioglossus during spontaneous quiet breathing with mean peak displacement between 0.5–2 mm, with more displacement in the posterior region than the anterior. This regional heterogeneity disappeared during voluntary targeted breathing. This may be due to different neural drive to genioglossus during voluntary breathing. During inspiratory resistive loading, the observed genioglossus motion may serve to maintain upper airway patency by balancing intraluminal negative pressure with positive pressure generated by upper airway dilatory muscles. In contrast, changes in EELV were not accompanied by major changes in genioglossus motion.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Influence of respiratory mechanics and drive on genioglossus movement under ultrasound imaging</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae9:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin C.

The psychometric properties of the ten-item Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K10) have been extensively explored in civilian populations. However, documentation of its psychometric properties in military populations is limited, and there is no universally accepted cut-off score on the K10 to distinguish clinical vs. sub-clinical levels of distress. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the K10 in Canadian Armed Forces personnel. Data on 6700 Regular Forces personnel were obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey. The internal consistency and factor structure of the K10 (range, 0–40) were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to select optimal cut-offs for the K10, using the presence/absence of any of four past-month disorders as the outcome (posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). Cronbach’s alpha (0.88) indicated a high level of internal consistency of the K10. Results from CFA indicated that a single-factor 10-item construct had an acceptable overall fit: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05; 90% confidence interval (CI):0.05–0.06, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.99, weighted root mean square residual (WRMR) = 2.06. K10 scores were strongly associated with both the presence and recency of all four measured disorders. The area under the ROC curve was 0.92, demonstrating excellent predictive value for past-30-day disorders. A K10 score of 10 or greater was optimal for screening purposes (sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 83%), while a score of 17 or greater (sensitivity = 53%; specificity = 97%) was optimal for prevalence estimation of clinically significant psychological distress, in that it resulted in equal numbers of false positives and false negatives. Our results suggest that K10 scale has satisfactory psychometric properties for use as a measure of non-specific psychological distress in the military population.</content></content><title>The psychometric properties of the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) in Canadian military personnel</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7b:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hugues Sampasa-Kanyinga, Mark A.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes. HFD mice showed increments in colonic MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, as well as a decrease in &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in both colonic and epididymal tissues. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in SP and iNOS expression in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice. In preparations from HFD mice, electrically evoked contractions upon NOS blockade or mediated by tachykininergic stimulation were enhanced.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes. HFD mice showed increments in colonic MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, as well as a decrease in &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in both colonic and epididymal tissues. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in SP and iNOS expression in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice. In preparations from HFD mice, electrically evoked contractions upon NOS blockade or mediated by tachykininergic stimulation were enhanced. In HFD mice, Apigenin counteracted the increase in body and epididymal fat weight, as well as the alterations of metabolic indexes. Apigenin reduced also MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 colonic levels as well as eosinophil infiltration, SP and iNOS expression, along with a normalization of electrically evoked tachykininergic and nitrergic contractions. In addition, apigenin normalized &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in epididymal fat tissues, but not in colonic specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions and implications &lt;p&gt;Apigenin prevents systemic metabolic alterations, counteracts enteric inflammation and normalizes colonic dysmotility associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>bd7e623b</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195502</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195502</originId><published>1523480400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195502</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>26</engagement><author><name>Kuzmin, E., VanderSluis, B., Wang, W., Tan, G., Deshpande, R., Chen, Y., Usaj, M., Balint, A., Mattiazzi Usaj, M., van Leeuwen, J., Koch, E.

Currently approved monoamine modulating antidepressant and anxiolytic pharmaceutics fail in over one third of patients due to delayed and variable therapeutic effect, adverse reactions preceding the therapeutic action, and adherence issues. Even with adequate adherence to the regimen and tolerability, one third of the patients do not respond to any class of antidepressants. There is a strong correlation between treatment resistant depression and increase in inflammatory cytokines in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with pain and inflammation. While a link between pain, inflammation and depression has been suggested it remains unclear which anti-inflammatory treatment may be beneficial to patients with depression and anxiety due to pain. Here, we analyzed 430,783 FDA adverse effect reports of patients treated for pain to identify potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of various anti-inflammatory medications. Patients treated for depression or patients taking any known antidepressants were excluded. The odds ratio analysis of 139,072 NSAID reports revealed that ketoprofen was associated with decreased reports of depression by a factor of 2.32 (OR 0.43 and 95% Confidence Interval [0.31, 0.59]) and decreased reports of anxiety by a factor of 2.86 (OR 0.35 [0.22, 0.56]), diclofenac with decreased depression reports by a factor of 2.22 (OR 0.45 [0.40, 0.49]) and anxiety by a factor of 2.13 (OR 0.47 [0.41, 0.54]), while naproxen decreased depression reports by a factor of 1.92 (OR 0.52 [0.49, 0.57]) and anxiety by a factor of 1.23 (OR 0.81 [0.75, 0.88]). Other NSAIDs did not exhibit any noticeable antidepressant and/or anxiolytic effect.</content></content><title>Population scale retrospective analysis reveals distinctive antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of diclofenac, ketoprofen and naproxen in patients with pain</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccad:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tigran Makunts, Isaac V.

The odds ratio analysis of 139,072 NSAID reports revealed that ketoprofen was associated with decreased reports of depression by a factor of 2.32 (OR 0.43 and 95% Confidence Interval [0.31, 0.59]) and decreased reports of anxiety by a factor of 2.86 (OR 0.35 [0.22, 0.56]), diclofenac with decreased depression reports by a factor of 2.22 (OR 0.45 [0.40, 0.49]) and anxiety by a factor of 2.13 (OR 0.47 [0.41, 0.54]), while naproxen decreased depression reports by a factor of 1.92 (OR 0.52 [0.49, 0.57]) and anxiety by a factor of 1.23 (OR 0.81 [0.75, 0.88]). Other NSAIDs did not exhibit any noticeable antidepressant and/or anxiolytic effect.</description><crawled>1524073508287</crawled><fingerprint>71734325</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195521</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195521</originId><published>1524085200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195521</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Shreyas Malpathak</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024908?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Direct dynamics simulations of the unimolecular dissociation of dioxetane: Probing the non-RRKM dynamics</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024908?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1631cf1c4b3:26b9582:11c251fd</id><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1525198996659</crawled><fingerprint>23da9100</fingerprint><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024908?af=R</originId><published>1525066373000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Zhiyao Tang, Wenting Xu, Guoyi Zhou, Yongfei Bai, Jiaxiang Li, Xuli Tang, Dima Chen, Qing Liu, Wenhong Ma, Gaoming Xiong, Honglin He, Nianpeng He, Yanpei Guo, Qiang Guo, Jiangling Zhu, Wenxuan Han, Huifeng Hu, Jingyun Fang, Zongqiang Xie</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4033.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content regulate productivity and carbon (C) sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems.

Past and recent attempts at devising objective biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid have focused on abundance measures of time-dependent proteins. Similar independent determinants would be most welcome in diagnosing the most common form of TBI, mild TBI (mTBI), which remains difficult to define and confirm based solely on clinical criteria. There are currently no consensus diagnostic measures that objectively define individuals as having sustained an acute mTBI. Plasma metabolomic analyses have recently evolved to offer an alternative to proteomic analyses, offering an orthogonal diagnostic measure to what is currently available. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a developed set of metabolomic biomarkers is able to objectively classify college athletes sustaining mTBI from non-injured teammates, within 6 hours of trauma and whether such a biomarker panel could be effectively applied to an independent cohort of TBI and control subjects.
A 6-metabolite panel was developed from biomarkers that had their identities confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in our Athlete cohort. These biomarkers were defined at ≤6 hours following mTBI and objectively classified mTBI athletes from teammate controls, and provided similar classification of these groups at the 2, 3, and 7 days post-mTBI. The same 6-metabolite panel, when applied to a separate, independent cohort provided statistically similar results despite major differences between the two cohorts. Our confirmed plasma biomarker panel objectively classifies acute mTBI cases from controls within 6 hours of injury in our two independent cohorts. While encouraged by our initial results, we expect future studies to expand on these initial observations.</content></content><title>Plasma metabolomic biomarkers accurately classify acute mild traumatic brain injury from controls</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f3:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Massimo S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Adult leg length is influenced by nutrition in the first few years of life. Adult head circumference is an indicator of brain growth. Cross-sectional studies indicate inverse associations with dementia risk, but there have been few prospective studies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, and anthropometric measures taken, with ascertainment of incident dementia, and mortality, three to five years later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the original at risk cohort of 13,587 persons aged 65 years and over, 2,443 (18.0%) were lost to follow-up; 10,540 persons with skull circumference assessments were followed up for 40,466 person years, and 10,400 with leg length assessments were followed up for 39,954 person years. There were 1,009 cases of incident dementia, and 1,605 dementia free deaths. The fixed effect pooled meta-analysed adjusted subhazard ratio (ASHR) for leg length (highest vs. lowest quarter) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.66–0.97) and for skull circumference was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.84–1.25), with no heterogeneity of effect between sites (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Leg length measurements tended to be shorter at follow-up, particularly for those with baseline cognitive impairment and dementia. However, leg length change was not associated with dementia incidence (ASHR, per cm 1.006, 95% CI 0.992–1.020), and the effect of leg length was little altered after adjusting for baseline frailty (ASHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–0.99). A priori hypotheses regarding effect modification by gender or educational level were not supported. However, the effect of skull circumference was modified by gender (M vs F ASHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.98), but in the opposite direction to that hypothesized with a greater protective effect of larger skull dimensions in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Consistent findings across settings provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life.

Background &lt;p&gt;Adult leg length is influenced by nutrition in the first few years of life. Adult head circumference is an indicator of brain growth. Cross-sectional studies indicate inverse associations with dementia risk, but there have been few prospective studies.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, and anthropometric measures taken, with ascertainment of incident dementia, and mortality, three to five years later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the original at risk cohort of 13,587 persons aged 65 years and over, 2,443 (18.0%) were lost to follow-up; 10,540 persons with skull circumference assessments were followed up for 40,466 person years, and 10,400 with leg length assessments were followed up for 39,954 person years. There were 1,009 cases of incident dementia, and 1,605 dementia free deaths. The fixed effect pooled meta-analysed adjusted subhazard ratio (ASHR) for leg length (highest vs. lowest quarter) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.66–0.97) and for skull circumference was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.84–1.25), with no heterogeneity of effect between sites (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Leg length measurements tended to be shorter at follow-up, particularly for those with baseline cognitive impairment and dementia. However, leg length change was not associated with dementia incidence (ASHR, per cm 1.006, 95% CI 0.992–1.020), and the effect of leg length was little altered after adjusting for baseline frailty (ASHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–0.99). A priori hypotheses regarding effect modification by gender or educational level were not supported. However, the effect of skull circumference was modified by gender (M vs F ASHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.98), but in the opposite direction to that hypothesized with a greater protective effect of larger skull dimensions in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Consistent findings across settings provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life. Leg length is a relatively stable marker of early life nutritional programming, which may confer brain reserve and protect against neurodegeneration in later life through mitigation of cardiometabolic risk. Further clarification of these associations could inform predictive models for future dementia incidence in the context of secular trends in adult height, and invigorate global efforts to improve childhood nutrition, growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>9d93eb2c</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195133</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195133</originId><published>1523566800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195133</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Li-Yun Lin</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196026</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li-Yun Lin, Chiung-Chi Peng, Yeh Chen, Boa-Chan Huang, Chun Chao Chang, Robert Y.

Nearly half of respondents agreed that dementia is a normal and non-preventable part of ageing, but belief in the potential for prevention may be improving over time. The role of cardiovascular risk factors was poorly understood overall. Less than half of respondents reported belief in the availability of a cure for dementia. The value of seeking treatment was highly endorsed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Results suggest that knowledge about the potential for dementia prevention and treatment remains poor but may be improving over time.

We present a new modeling and computational tool that computes rigorous summaries of network dynamics over large sets of parameter values. These summaries, organized in a database, can be searched for observed dynamics, e.g., bistability and hysteresis, to discover parameter regimes over which they are supported. We illustrate our approach on several networks underlying the restriction point of the cell cycle in humans and yeast. We rank networks by how robustly they support hysteresis, which is the observed phenotype. We find that the best 6-node human network and the yeast network share similar topology and robustness of hysteresis, in spite of having no homology between the corresponding nodes of the network. Our approach provides a new tool linking network structure and dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/StTE5SEaAR8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Identifying robust hysteresis in networks</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392bc:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomáš Gedeon, Bree Cummins, Shaun Harker, Konstantin Mischaikow&lt;/p&gt;

The ABCG2 multidrug transporter provides resistance against various endo- and xenobiotics, and protects the stem cells against toxins and stress conditions. We have shown earlier that a GFP-tagged version of ABCG2 is fully functional and may be used to follow the expression, localization and function of this transporter in living cells. In the present work we have overexpressed GFP-ABCG2, driven by a constitutive (CAG) promoter, in HUES9 human embryonic stem cells. Stem cell clones were generated to express the wild-type and a substrate-mutant (R482G) GFP-ABCG2 variant, by using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system.

The ABCG2 multidrug transporter provides resistance against various endo- and xenobiotics, and protects the stem cells against toxins and stress conditions. We have shown earlier that a GFP-tagged version of ABCG2 is fully functional and may be used to follow the expression, localization and function of this transporter in living cells. In the present work we have overexpressed GFP-ABCG2, driven by a constitutive (CAG) promoter, in HUES9 human embryonic stem cells. Stem cell clones were generated to express the wild-type and a substrate-mutant (R482G) GFP-ABCG2 variant, by using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. We found that the stable overexpression of these transgenes did not change the pluripotency and growth properties of the stem cells, nor their differentiation capacity to hepatocytes or cardiomyocytes. ABCG2 overexpression provided increased toxin resistance in the stem cells, and protected the derived cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin toxicity. These studies document the potential of a stable ABCG2 expression for engineering toxin-resistant human pluripotent stem cells and selected stem cell derived tissues.</description><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>ad7fb478</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194925</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194925</originId><published>1523566800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194925</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01347/20180509/images/medium/jp-2018-013473_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01347&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The red flour beetle, &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt;, is an important model insect and agricultural pest. However, many standard genetic tools are lacking or underdeveloped in this system. Here, we present a set of new reagents to augment existing &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; genetic tools. We demonstrate a new GAL4 driver line that employs the promoter of a ribosomal protein gene to drive expression of a UAS responder in the fat body. We also present a novel dual fluorescent reporter that labels cell membranes and nuclei with different fluorophores for the analysis of cellular morphology. This approach also demonstrates the functionality of the viral T2A peptide for bicistronic gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt;. To facilitate classical genetic analysis, we created lines with visible genetic markers by CRISPR-mediated disruption of the &lt;i&gt;yellow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ebony&lt;/i&gt; body color loci with a cassette carrying an attP site, enabling future φC31-mediated integration. Together, the reagents presented here will facilitate more robust genetic analysis in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; and serve as a blueprint for the further development of this powerful model’s genetic toolkit.</content></content><title>Expanding the genetic toolkit of &amp;lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66dc:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Johnathan C.

Non-contact heart rate (HR) measurement from facial videos has attracted high interests due to its convenience and cost effectiveness. However, accurate and robust HR estimation under various realistic scenarios remain a very challenging problem. In this paper, we develop a novel system which can achieve a robust and accurate HR estimation under those challenging scenarios. First, to minimize tracking-artifacts arising from large head motions and facial expressions, we propose a joint face detection and alignment method which can produce alignment-friendly facial bounding boxes with reliable initial facial shapes, facilitating accurate and robust face alignment even in the presence of large pose variations and expressions. Second, different from most existing methods [1–5] which derive pulse signals from predetermined grid cells (i.e. local patches), our patches are varying-sized triangles generated adaptively to exclude negative effects from non-rigid facial motions. Third, we propose an adaptive patch selection method to choose patches which contain skin regions and are more likely to contain useful information, followed by an independent component analysis, for an accurate HR estimate. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our own dataset demonstrated that, comparing with the state-of-the-art methods [1–3], our method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by a large margin, ranging from 12% to 63%, and can provide a robust and accurate estimation under various challenging scenarios.</content></content><title>Accurate face alignment and adaptive patch selection for heart rate estimation from videos under realistic scenarios</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7e:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhiwei Wang, Xin Yang, Kwang-Ting Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, we identified a regulatory pathway involving nuclear PTEN–mediated miRNA generation that limits the production of MyD88 and thereby limits sepsis-associated mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525205801355</crawled><fingerprint>312b6de0</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/528/eaai9085.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/528/eaai9085?rss=1</originId><published>1525203902000</published><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/528/eaai9085?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524690000000</updated><author><name>Christian Larbi Ayisi</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196100</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Larbi Ayisi, Jinliang Zhao, Jun-Wei Wu&lt;/p&gt;
This study was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fish oil (FO) with palm oil (PO) in juvenile Nile tilapia, &lt;i&gt;Oreochromis niloticus&lt;/i&gt; (9.34± 0.02g initial weight) with emphasis on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities as well as serum biochemical parameters. Also, lysozyme activity (LYZ), respiratory burst (RB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and resistance to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; were investigated. Fish were stocked in 15 rectangular fiber glass tanks (150× 60× 40 cm) at 40 fish per tank with water maintained at 210 litres. Fish were fed five isonitrogenous (33% crude protein) and isolipidic (10% lipid) diets with PO included at 0% (0% PO), 25% (25% PO), 50% (50%PO), 75% (75% PO) and 100% (100% PO) for 8 weeks. The findings demonstrated that growth, and feed utilization was not compromised when PO was used in place of FO either partially or totally. Except for protease activity which was not significantly altered, lipase and amylase activities were significantly altered when FO was replaced with PO. There were no significant differences among treatments for CAT, SOD and LYZ. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) in fish fed 100% PO was significantly lower than all other groups whiles total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of fish fed 0% PO was significantly higher than all other groups. Fish fed 0% PO, 25% PO and 50% PO had glutathione reductase (GR) significantly higher than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. RB in fish fed 0% PO were significantly lower than fish fed 75% PO and 100% PO. Also, fish fed 0% PO had significantly lower total protein (TP) compared with groups fed 50% PO and 75% PO. Fish fed diets with PO had similar resistance ability to &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus iniae&lt;/i&gt; as those fed diets with FO. However, the liver function was likely to be compromised due to the increase in aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatas (ALP) along increasing PO inclusion levels. AST, total protein, triacylglycerol (TAG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0.05) in groups fed higher levels of PO. This study therefore concludes that feeding tilapia fingerlings with diets containing PO affects antioxidant and innate immune parameters negatively due to the reduction in LYS, TAC, GR, MDA, CAT, SOD and GSHpx.</content></content><title>Replacement of fish oil with palm oil: Effects on growth performance, innate immune response, antioxidant capacity and disease resistance in Nile tilapia (&amp;lt;i&gt;Oreochromis niloticus&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67af:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Larbi Ayisi, Jinliang Zhao, Jun-Wei Wu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus agalactiae&lt;/i&gt;, or group B streptococcus (GBS), is an important pathogen as it is the leading cause of neonatal deaths due to sepsis, meningitis or bacterial pneumonia. Although the development of an effective and safe GBS vaccine is on the agenda of many research labs, there is no GBS vaccine on the market yet. In the present study we attempted to engineer a live vaccine strain based on Bac, a surface protein of GBS, incorporated into a surface fimbrial protein of probiotic Enterococcus. The resulting strain induced specific systemic and local immune responses in mice and provided protection against GBS when administered via the intranasal, oral or intravaginal immunization routes.</content></content><title>Development of experimental GBS vaccine for mucosal immunization</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1632c3c60b0:1621673:3dd877af</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by T.

Currently, nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) with short pulse duration and non-thermal effects have various potential applications in medicine and biology, especially in tumor ablation. Additionally, there are a few investigations on its proliferative effects in the normal cell. Clinically, proliferation of endothelial cells can perhaps accelerate the stent endothelialization and reduce the risk of acute thrombosis. To explore the feasibility using nsPEFs to induce proliferation of endothelial cells, in this study, porcine iliac endothelial (PIEC) cell line was cultured and tested by CCK-8 assay after nsPEFs treatment. The results reflected that nsPEFs with low field strength (100ns, 5 kV/cm, 10 pulses) had a significant proliferative effect with an increase in the PIEC cell growth of 16% after a 48 hour’ post-treatment. To further understand the mechanism of cell proliferation, intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration was measured through fluo-4 AM and reactive oxygen species assay was applied to estimate the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the total nitric oxide assay for NO production in the cultured medium was evaluated. An enhanced concentration of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ROS were observed, while the concentration of extracellular NO also increased after nsPEFs treatment. Such experimental results demonstrated that nsPEFs with appropriate pulse parameters could effectively enhance cell proliferation on PIEC cells, and the cell proliferation associated strongly with the changes of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concertation, ROS and NO production induced by nsPEFs treatment. This in vitro preliminary study indicates that as a novel physical doping, the nsPEFs have potential in stimulating endothelial cells to accelerate stent endothelialization.</content></content><title>Nanosecond pulsed electric fields promoting the proliferation of porcine iliac endothelial cells: An in vitro study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a69:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuchen Zhang, Feihong Dong, Zhengxin Liu, Jinsong Guo, Jue Zhang, Jing Fang&lt;/p&gt;

Around 70% of circulating alpha-2-antiplasmin (α2AP), the main natural plasmin inhibitor, is N-terminally cleaved between residues Pro12 and Asn13 by antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme. This converts native Met-α2AP into the more potent fibrinolysis inhibitor Asn-α2AP. The Arg6Trp (R6W) polymorphism affects the N-terminal cleavage rate of Met-α2AP in a purified system, with ~8-fold faster conversion of Met(R6)-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP. To date, assays to determine N-terminally intact Met-α2AP in plasma have been limited to an ELISA that only measures Met(R6)-α2AP. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and all α2AP forms (total-α2AP) in order to develop specific Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP ELISAs. Recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and Asn-α2AP were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. Using hybridoma technology, a panel of 25 mAbs was generated against a mixture of recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP. All mAbs were evaluated for their specific reactivity using the three recombinant α2APs in one-site non-competitive ELISAs. Three mAbs were selected to develop sandwich-type ELISAs. MA-AP37E2 and MA-AP34C4 were selected for their specific reactivity against Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, and used for coating. MA-AP15D7 was selected for its reactivity against total-α2AP and used for detection. With the novel ELISAs we determined Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP levels in plasma samples and we showed that Met(R6)-α2AP was converted faster into Asn-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP in a plasma milieu. In conclusion, we developed two specific ELISAs for Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, in plasma. This will enable us to determine N-terminal heterogeneity of α2AP in plasma samples.</content></content><title>Generation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminus of alpha-2-antiplasmin</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3aee:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiraazkhan Abdul, Miet Peeters, Els Brouwers, Joyce J.

The molecular mechanisms through which dendritic cells (DCs) prime T helper 2 (Th2) responses, including those elicited by parasitic helminths, remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that soluble egg antigen (SEA) from &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, which is well known to drive potent Th2 responses, triggers DCs to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which subsequently—in an autocrine manner—induces OX40 ligand (OX40L) expression to license these DCs to drive Th2 responses. Mechanistically, SEA was found to promote PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis through Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, and via a downstream signaling cascade involving spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2). In addition, this pathway was activated independently of the actions of omega-1 (ω-1), a previously described Th2-priming glycoprotein present in SEA. These findings were supported by in vivo murine data showing that ω-1–independent Th2 priming by SEA was mediated by Dectin-2 and Syk signaling in DCs. Finally, we found that Dectin-2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;, and to a lesser extent Dectin-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, displayed impaired Th2 responses and reduced egg-driven granuloma formation following &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; infection, highlighting the physiological importance of this pathway in Th2 polarization during a helminth infection. In summary, we identified a novel pathway in DCs involving Dectin-1/2-Syk-PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OX40L through which Th2 immune responses are induced.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JxCwEstI3Wg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Dectin-1/2–induced autocrine PGE&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; signaling licenses dendritic cells to prime Th2 responses</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162d9ef60bd:bb316f:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria M.

The obtained results unveil that, as compared to the standard range‐separated density functionals, our newly developed OT‐RSHs not only give an improved description on the dipole moments of the molecules with multi‐reference character but also the quality of their predictions is better than other conventional and recently proposed DFT approximations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><crawled>1523899941694</crawled><fingerprint>34170658</fingerprint><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25221?af=R</originId><published>1523356985000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Sicong Wang</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/E5bP5FIhEQY/s41598-018-24101-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24101-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/E5bP5FIhEQY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162dad8751f:3ea39da:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24101-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Selective 6H-SiC White Light Emission by Picosecond Laser Direct Writing&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/E5bP5FIhEQY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524090041631</crawled><fingerprint>75665880</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24101-y</originId><published>1524121200000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1525208400000</updated><author><name>Ryodai Takagaki</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryodai Takagaki, Yuki Ishida, Tsuyoshi Sadakiyo, Yoshifumi Taniguchi, Takeo Sakurai, Hitoshi Mitsuzumi, Hikaru Watanabe, Shigeharu Fukuda, Shimpei Ushio&lt;/p&gt;
Isomaltodextrin (IMD) is a novel dietary fiber-like polysaccharide: a type of α-glucan produced from starch using enzymes derived from microorganisms. The results of cohort studies show that dietary fiber can prevent cardiovascular disorders caused by lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of excess fat absorption by dietary fiber is known to be one of the mechanisms, and it is also known that the actions of dietary fiber vary depending on factors such as its structure or origin. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory actions of IMD on fat absorption, and analyzed its mechanism of action. In rats, the absorption of fat given by gavage was significantly lower at 1, 2, and 6 hours after IMD administration than after vehicle administration. In humans, IMD was associated with a lesser increase in blood triglycerides in subjects whose blood triglycerides were otherwise apt to rise. We also found by in vitro emulsion studies that IMD, which had no effect on digestive enzyme activity or emulsion formation, stabilized the micro size micelle by inducing enlarged micelle particle size and increased zeta potential. In conclusion, the mechanism of inhibition of fat absorption by IMD may be a delay in micelle particles accessing the intestinal epithelium through changes in the surface structure and the physical properties of the micelle particles.</content></content><title>Effects of isomaltodextrin in postprandial lipid kinetics: Rat study and human randomized crossover study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a71:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ryodai Takagaki, Yuki Ishida, Tsuyoshi Sadakiyo, Yoshifumi Taniguchi, Takeo Sakurai, Hitoshi Mitsuzumi, Hikaru Watanabe, Shigeharu Fukuda, Shimpei Ushio&lt;/p&gt;

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Endothelial dysfunction is thought to be an early indicator of risk for cardiovascular disease and has been associated with both stress and depression in adults and adolescents. Less is known of these relationships in younger populations, where the origins of CVD is thought to manifest. This study examined the effects of questionnaire derived psychosocial stress and depressive symptoms on endothelial function among children, following them through to adolescence.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Participants were 203 grade 2 children (111 girls; M age = 7.6 ± 0.3 years) from the LOOK longitudinal study, who were followed through to adolescence (16 years). Self-reported psychosocial stress and depression were assessed using the validated Children’s Stress Questionnaire and a modified and validated version of the Children’s Depression Inventory respectively; endothelial function was assessed using EndoPAT 2000 system at follow-up only; and adjustments were made for fitness, pubertal development and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Although all relationships occurred in the hypothesised direction, no cross-sectional or prospective evidence of early symptoms of psychological stress or depression being associated with endothelial dysfunction was found among our asymptomatic cohort of adolescents (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; .05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In contrast to previous findings in adolescents, our data provided little evidence of any relationship between current or previous psychosocial stress or depression and endothelial function in 16-year-old boys and girls.

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Bi-stability in cooperative transport by ants in the presence of obstacles</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e3a:abeb7260</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan E.

The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1525975049460</crawled><fingerprint>dd03e042</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</originId><published>1525986000000</published><recrawled>1525984928890</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524085200000</updated><author><name>Svetlana N.

Biodistribution studies of &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time.

Four public sector facilities, including the only three facilities in which services were free, accounted for 71% (8,630/12,202) of all neonatal admissions. Large facilities (&gt;900 annual admissions) with adequate infrastructure tended to have high bed occupancy (over 100% in two facilities), high mortality (15%), and high patient to nurse ratios (7–15 patients per nurse). Twenty-one smaller, predominantly private, facilities were judged insufficiently resourced to provide adequate care.

Chile pepper (&lt;i&gt;Capsicum annuum&lt;/i&gt;) is an important high valued crop worldwide, and when grown on a large scale has problems with weeds. One important herbicide used is glyphosate. Glyphosate inactivates the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (&lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt;), a key enzyme in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids. A transgenic approach towards making glyphosate resistant plants, entails introducing copies of a gene encoding for glyphosate-resistant EPSPS enzyme into the plant. The main objective of our work was to use an intragenic approach to confer resistance to glyphosate in chile which would require using only chile genes for transformation including the selectable marker. Tobacco was used as the transgenic system to identify different gene constructs that would allow for the development of the intragenic system for chile, since chile transformation is inefficient. An &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from chile and mutagenized to introduce substitutions that are known to make the encoded enzyme resistant to glyphosate. The promoter for &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from chile and the mutagenized chile &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; cDNA was engineered behind both the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter and the &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; promoter. The leaves from the transformants were checked for resistance to glyphosate using a cut leaf assay. In tobacco, though both gene constructs exhibited some degree of resistance to glyphosate, the construct with the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter was more effective and as such chile was transformed with this gene construct. The chile transformants showed resistance to low concentrations of glyphosate.

Chile pepper (&lt;i&gt;Capsicum annuum&lt;/i&gt;) is an important high valued crop worldwide, and when grown on a large scale has problems with weeds. One important herbicide used is glyphosate. Glyphosate inactivates the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (&lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt;), a key enzyme in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids. A transgenic approach towards making glyphosate resistant plants, entails introducing copies of a gene encoding for glyphosate-resistant EPSPS enzyme into the plant. The main objective of our work was to use an intragenic approach to confer resistance to glyphosate in chile which would require using only chile genes for transformation including the selectable marker. Tobacco was used as the transgenic system to identify different gene constructs that would allow for the development of the intragenic system for chile, since chile transformation is inefficient. An &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from chile and mutagenized to introduce substitutions that are known to make the encoded enzyme resistant to glyphosate. The promoter for &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene was isolated from chile and the mutagenized chile &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; cDNA was engineered behind both the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter and the &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; promoter. The leaves from the transformants were checked for resistance to glyphosate using a cut leaf assay. In tobacco, though both gene constructs exhibited some degree of resistance to glyphosate, the construct with the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter was more effective and as such chile was transformed with this gene construct. The chile transformants showed resistance to low concentrations of glyphosate. Furthermore, preliminary studies showed that the mutated &lt;i&gt;EPSPS&lt;/i&gt; gene driven by the &lt;i&gt;CaMV35S&lt;/i&gt; promoter could be used as a selectable marker for transformation. We have shown that an intragenic approach can be used to confer glyphosate-resistance in chile. However, we need a stronger chile promoter and a mutated chile gene that encodes for a more glyphosate resistant EPSPS protein.</description><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>1b2d4174</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194666</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194666</originId><published>1523566800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194666</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Ladislau Bölöni</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195331</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ladislau Bölöni, Taranjeet Singh Bhatia, Saad Ahmad Khan, Jonathan Streater, Stephen M.

We describe a computational model of social norms based on identifying values that a certain culture finds desirable such as dignity, generosity and politeness. The model quantifies these values in the form of Culture-Sanctioned Social Metrics (CSSMs) and treats social norms as the requirement to maximize these metrics from the perspective of the self, peers and public. This model can be used to create realistic social simulations, to explain or predict human behavior in specific scenarios, or as a component of robots or agents that need to interact with humans in specific social-cultural settings. We validate the model by using it to represent a complex deception scenario and showing that it can yield non-trivial insights such as the explanation of apparently irrational human behavior.</content></content><title>Towards a computational model of social norms</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd89:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ladislau Bölöni, Taranjeet Singh Bhatia, Saad Ahmad Khan, Jonathan Streater, Stephen M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Paritaprevir inhibits organic anion–transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, which transport bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinemia is an adverse event reported during hepatitis C treatment. Gadoxetic acid is also transported by OATP1B1/1B3. We evaluated whether the enhancement effect in gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could predict the plasma concentration of paritaprevir and might anticipate the development of hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective study evaluated 27 patients with hepatitis C who underwent gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging prior to treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir. The contrast enhancement index (CEI), a measure of liver enhancement during the hepatobiliary phase, was assessed. Plasma trough concentrations, and concentrations at 2, 4, and 6 h after dosing were determined 7 d after the start of treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven patients (26%) developed hyperbilirubinemia (≥ 1.6 mg/dl). Paritaprevir trough concentration (C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt;) was significantly higher in patients with hyperbilirubinemia than in those without (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022). We found an inverse relationship between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; (r = 0.612, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), while there was not a significantly weak inverse relationship between AUC&lt;sub&gt;0–6 h&lt;/sub&gt; and CEI (r = −0.338, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.085). The partial correlation coefficient between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; was −0.425 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034), while excluding the effects of albumin and the FIB-4 index. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the CEI was relatively accurate in predicting hyperbilirubinemia, with area under the ROC of 0.882. Multivariate analysis showed that the CEI &amp;lt; 1.61 was the only independent predictor related to the development of hyperbilirubinemia, with an odds ratio of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 1.05–78.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hepatic enhancement with gadoxetic acid was independently related to paritaprevir concentration and was an independent pretreatment factor in predicting hyperbilirubinemia. Gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging can therefore be useful in determining the risk of paritaprevir-induced hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to predict paritaprevir-induced hyperbilirubinemia during treatment of hepatitis C</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e62:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hironao Okubo, Hitoshi Ando, Yushi Sorin, Eisuke Nakadera, Hiroo Fukada, Junichi Morishige, Akihisa Miyazaki, Kenichi Ikejima&lt;/p&gt;

Our study characterizes oncogenic and developmental programs in H3K27M-glioma at single-cell resolution and across genetic subclones, suggesting potential therapeutic targets in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524160533249</crawled><fingerprint>82430325</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/331.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Genetics, Medicine, Diseases</item></keywords><published>1524159423000</published><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/331?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/331?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1525726800000</updated><author><name>Tatsuya Ishii</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197201</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Ishii, Yasuyuki Kimura, Masanori Ichise, Keisuke Takahata, Soichiro Kitamura, Sho Moriguchi, Manabu Kubota, Ming-Rong Zhang, Makiko Yamada, Makoto Higuchi, Yoshiro Okubo, Tetsuya Suhara&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Correction: Anatomical relationships between serotonin 5-HT&amp;lt;sub&gt;2A&amp;lt;/sub&gt; and dopamine D&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; receptors in living human brain</title><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197201</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42273:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Ishii, Yasuyuki Kimura, Masanori Ichise, Keisuke Takahata, Soichiro Kitamura, Sho Moriguchi, Manabu Kubota, Ming-Rong Zhang, Makiko Yamada, Makoto Higuchi, Yoshiro Okubo, Tetsuya Suhara&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><fingerprint>3a28b0a1</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197201</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197201</originId><published>1525726800000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>6</engagement><author><name>Ailie Robinson, Annette O.

Monocyte-like cell lines (MCLCs), including THP-1, HL-60 and U-937 cells, are used routinely as surrogates for isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To systematically evaluate these immortalised cells and PBMCs as model systems to study inflammation relevant to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes and immuno-metabolism, we compared mRNA expression of inflammation-relevant genes, cell surface expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers, and chemotactic responses to inflammatory stimuli. Messenger RNA expression analysis suggested most genes were present at similar levels across all undifferentiated cells, though notably, &lt;i&gt;IDO1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and catabolises tryptophan to kynureninase (shown to be elevated in serum from diabetic patients), was not expressed in any PMA-treated MCLC, but present in GM-CSF-treated PBMCs. There was little overall difference in the pattern of expression of CD markers across all cells, though absolute expression levels varied considerably and the correlation between MCLCs and PBMCs was improved upon MCLC differentiation. Functionally, THP-1 and PBMCs migrated in response to chemoattractants in a transwell assay, with varying sensitivity to MCP-1, MIP-1α and LTB-4. However, despite similar gene and CD expression profiles, U-937 cells were functionally impaired as no migration was observed to any chemoattractant. Our analysis reveals that the MCLCs examined only partly replicate the genotypic and phenotypic properties of human PBMCs. To overcome such issues a universal differentiation protocol should be implemented for these cell lines, similar to those already used with isolated monocytes. Although not perfect, in our hands the THP-1 cells represent the closest, simplified surrogate model of PBMCs for study of inflammatory cell migration.</content></content><title>Comparative genotypic and phenotypic analysis of human peripheral blood monocytes and surrogate monocyte-like cell lines commonly used in metabolic disease research</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559156:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Darren M.

On a daily basis, planktonic organisms migrate vertically and thus experience widely varying conditions in their physico-chemical environment. In the Gulf of Finland, these changes are larger than values predicted by climate change scenarios predicted for the next century (up to 0.5 units in pH and 5°C in temperature). In this work, we are interested in how temporal variations in physico-chemical characteristics of the water column on a daily and weekly scale influence oxidative stress level and antioxidant responses in the planktonic copepod of the genus &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt;. Responses were determined from samples collected during a two-week field survey in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Our results showed that GST (Glutathione-S-transferase) enzyme activity increased in the surface waters between Weeks I and II, indicating antioxidant defense mechanism activation. This is most likely due to elevating temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen observed between these two weeks. During Week II also GSSG (oxidized glutathione) was detected, indicating that copepods responded to stressor(s) in the environment. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Acartia&lt;/i&gt; copepods seem fairly tolerant to weekly fluctuations in environmental conditions in coastal and estuarine areas, in terms of antioxidant defense and oxidative stress. This could be directly connected to a very efficient glutathione cycling system acting as antioxidant defense system for neutralizing ROS and avoiding elevated levels of LPX.</content></content><title>Oxidative stress and antioxidant defense responses in &amp;lt;i&gt;Acartia&amp;lt;/i&gt; copepods in relation to environmental factors</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363e:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olivier Glippa, Jonna Engström-Öst, Mirella Kanerva, Anni Rein, Kristiina Vuori&lt;/p&gt;

However, it is still a challenging task to aggregate heterogeneous biological information such as gene expression and gene interactions to achieve more accurate inference for prediction and discovery of new gene interactions. In particular, how to generate a unified vector representation to integrate diverse input data is a key challenge addressed here. We propose a scalable and robust deep learning framework to learn embedded representations to unify known gene interactions and gene expression for gene interaction predictions. These low-dimensional embeddings derive deeper insights into the structure of rapidly accumulating and diverse gene interaction networks and greatly simplify downstream modeling. We compare the predictive power of our deep embeddings to the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. The results suggest that our deep embeddings achieve significantly more accurate predictions. Moreover, a set of novel gene interaction predictions are validated by up-to-date literature-based database entries.</content></content><title>GNE: A deep learning framework for gene network inference by aggregating biological information [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162c0bdc91d:18e7725:9f3b30f2</id><description>The topological landscape of gene interaction networks provides a rich source of information for inferring functional patterns of genes or proteins.

We propose a scalable and robust deep learning framework to learn embedded representations to unify known gene interactions and gene expression for gene interaction predictions. These low-dimensional embeddings derive deeper insights into the structure of rapidly accumulating and diverse gene interaction networks and greatly simplify downstream modeling. We compare the predictive power of our deep embeddings to the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. The results suggest that our deep embeddings achieve significantly more accurate predictions. Moreover, a set of novel gene interaction predictions are validated by up-to-date literature-based database entries.</description><crawled>1523652086045</crawled><fingerprint>996007d6</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/13/300996</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300996v1?rss=1</originId><published>1523602800000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300996v1?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Schikora-Tamarit, M.

This paper presents the design and fabrication of a multi-layer and multi-chamber microchip system using thiol-ene ‘click chemistry’ aimed for drug transport studies across tissue barrier models. The fabrication process enables rapid prototyping of multi-layer microfluidic chips using different thiol-ene polymer mixtures, where porous Teflon membranes for cell monolayer growth were incorporated by masked sandwiching thiol-ene-based fluid layers. Electrodes for trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were incorporated using low-melting soldering wires in combination with platinum wires, enabling parallel real-time monitoring of barrier integrity for the eight chambers. Additionally, the translucent porous Teflon membrane enabled optical monitoring of cell monolayers. The device was developed and tested with the Caco-2 intestinal model, and compared to the conventional Transwell system. Cell monolayer differentiation was assessed via &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; immunocytochemistry of tight junction and mucus proteins, P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) mediated efflux of Rhodamine 123, and brush border aminopeptidase activity. Monolayer tightness and relevance for drug delivery research was evaluated through permeability studies of mannitol, dextran and insulin, alone or in combination with the absorption enhancer tetradecylmaltoside (TDM). The thiol-ene-based microchip material and electrodes were highly compatible with cell growth. In fact, Caco-2 cells cultured in the device displayed differentiation, mucus production, directional transport and aminopeptidase activity within 9–10 days of cell culture, indicating robust barrier formation at a faster rate than in conventional Transwell models. The cell monolayer displayed high TEER and tightness towards hydrophilic compounds, whereas co-administration of an absorption enhancer elicited TEER-decrease and increased permeability similar to the Transwell cultures. The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices.</content></content><title>A multi-chamber microfluidic intestinal barrier model using Caco-2 cells for drug transport studies</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914f:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hsih-Yin Tan, Sofie Trier, Ulrik L.

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main products of indigestible carbohydrates that are fermented by microbiota in the hindgut. This study was designed to investigate the effects of oral SCFAs administration on the lipid metabolism of weaned pigs. A total of 21 barrows were randomly allocated into three groups, including control group (orally infused with 200 mL physiological saline per day), low dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 20.04 mM, propionic acid 7.71 mM and butyric acid 4.89 mM per day), and high dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 40.08 mM, propionic acid 15.42 mM and butyric acid 9.78 mM per day). The results showed that the average daily feed intake of SCFAs groups were lower than that of control group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Oral administration of SCFAs decreased the concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and insulin (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased the leptin concentration in serum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). The total fat, as well as TC and TG levels in liver, was decreased by oral SCFAs administration (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, SCFAs down-regulated the mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and enhanced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α) in liver (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). SCFAs also decreased FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor σ mRNA expressions in longissimus dorsi (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). And in abdominal fat, SCFAs reduced FAS and ACC mRNA expressions (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased CPT-1α mRNA expression (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). These results suggested that oral administration of SCFAs could attenuate fat deposition in weaned pigs via reducing lipogenesis and enhancing lipolysis of different tissues.</content></content><title>Oral administration of short chain fatty acids could attenuate fat deposition of pigs</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae6:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by A.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</content></content><title>Genome-wide analysis of basic helix-loop-helix superfamily members in peach</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aed:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chunhua Zhang, Ruchao Feng, Ruijuan Ma, Zhijun Shen, Zhixiang Cai, Zhizhong Song, Bin Peng, Mingliang Yu&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the expansion of literature on social accountability in low-and middle-income countries, little is known about how health providers experience daily social pressure and citizen feedback. This study used a narrative inquiry approach to explore the function of daily social accountability relations among maternal health care workers in rural Malawi. Through semi-structured interviews with 32 nurses and 19 clinicians, we collected 155 feedback cases allowing the identification of four main strategies social actors use to express their opinion and concerns about maternal health services. We found that women who used delivery care express their appreciation for successful deliveries directly to the health worker but complaints, such as on absenteeism and poor interpersonal behaviour, follow an indirect route via intermediaries such as the health workers’ spouse, co-workers or the health committee who forward some cases of misbehaviour to district authorities. The findings suggest that citizen feedback is important for the socialization, motivation and retention of maternal healthcare workers in under resourced rural settings. Practitioners and external development programmes should understand and recognize the value of already existing accountability mechanisms and foster social accountability approaches that allow communities as well as health workers to challenge the systemic obstacles to quality and respectful service delivery.</content></content><title>Informal social accountability in maternal health service delivery: A study in Northern Malawi</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3cd:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elsbet Lodenstein, Christine Ingemann, Joyce M.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of infection and poorer responses to vaccination. This suggests that CKD patients have an impaired responsiveness to all antigens, even those first encountered before CKD onset. To examine this we evaluated antibody responses against two childhood vaccine antigens, tetanus (TT) and diphtheria toxoids (DT) and two common pathogens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Enteritidis (SEn) in two independent cohorts consisting of age-matched individuals with and without CKD. Sera were evaluated for antigen-specific IgG titres and the functionality of antibody to SEn was assessed in a serum bactericidal assay. Surprisingly, patients with CKD and control subjects had comparable levels of IgG against TT and DT, suggesting preserved humoral memory responses to antigens encountered early in life. Lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG titres and serum bactericidal activity in patients with CKD were also not inferior to controls. CMV-specific IgG titres in seropositive CKD patients were similar or even increased compared to controls. Therefore, whilst responses to new vaccines in CKD are typically lower than expected, antibody responses to antigens commonly encountered prior to CKD onset are not. The immunodeficiency of CKD is likely characterised by failure to respond to new antigenic challenges and efforts to improve patient outcomes should be focussed here.</content></content><title>Humoral immunity to memory antigens and pathogens is maintained in patients with chronic kidney disease</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7add:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadezhda A.

The immunodeficiency of CKD is likely characterised by failure to respond to new antigenic challenges and efforts to improve patient outcomes should be focussed here.</description><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><fingerprint>939ee3f</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</originId><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195730</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524171600000</updated><author><name>Erick González-Medina</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196318</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Erick González-Medina, José Alfredo Castillo-Guerrero, Sharon Zinah Herzka, Guillermo Fernández&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Correction: High quality diet improves lipid metabolic profile and breeding performance in the blue-footed booby, a long-lived seabird</title><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196318</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7907:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erick González-Medina, José Alfredo Castillo-Guerrero, Sharon Zinah Herzka, Guillermo Fernández&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><fingerprint>227c5aee</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196318</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196318</originId><published>1524171600000</published><visual><contentType>image/png</contentType><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196318.g001</url><width>320</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>456</height></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>52</engagement><author><name>Jordi Paps</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/HQ3UQ_a9lFQ/s41467-018-04136-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reconstruction of the ancestral metazoan genome reveals an increase in genomic novelty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reconstruction of the ancestral metazoan genome reveals an increase in genomic novelty, Published online: 30 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04136-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04136-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Animals, the Metazoa, co-opted numerous unicellular genes in their transition to multicellularity.

BMI &amp;lt;18.5 is a clinical predictor of high short-term mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><fingerprint>8097dd7e</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195853</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195853</originId><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195853</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jie Liu</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022466?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>An efficient implementation of semiempirical quantum-chemical orthogonalization-corrected methods for excited-state dynamics</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022466?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d1f:9f3b30f2</id><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><fingerprint>8d52184e</fingerprint><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022466?af=R</originId><published>1524229155000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Armandas Balčytis</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/nZkeLJYaV5c/s41598-018-24583-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro-thermocouple on nano-membrane: thermometer for nanoscale measurements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micro-thermocouple on nano-membrane: thermometer for nanoscale measurements, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24583-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24583-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Micro-thermocouple on nano-membrane: thermometer for nanoscale measurements&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/nZkeLJYaV5c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Micro-thermocouple on nano-membrane: thermometer for nanoscale measurements</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24583-w</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162e25a1937:4987d3a:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro-thermocouple on nano-membrane: thermometer for nanoscale measurements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micro-thermocouple on nano-membrane: thermometer for nanoscale measurements, Published online: 20 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24583-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24583-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Micro-thermocouple on nano-membrane: thermometer for nanoscale measurements&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/nZkeLJYaV5c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1524215978295</crawled><fingerprint>4933091f</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24583-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24583-w</originId><published>1524207600000</published><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24583-w/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24583_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>165</height></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>72</engagement><author><name>Andrew J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Carriers of mutations in hereditary cancer predisposition genes represent a small but clinically important subgroup of oncology patients. The identification of causal germline mutations determines follow-up management, treatment options and genetic counselling in patients’ families. Targeted next-generation sequencing-based analyses using cancer-specific panels in high-risk individuals have been rapidly adopted by diagnostic laboratories. While the use of diagnosis-specific panels is straightforward in typical cases, individuals with unusual phenotypes from families with overlapping criteria require multiple panel testing. Moreover, narrow gene panels are limited by our currently incomplete knowledge about possible genetic dispositions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We have designed a multi-gene panel called CZECANCA (CZEch CAncer paNel for Clinical Application) for a sequencing analysis of 219 cancer-susceptibility and candidate predisposition genes associated with frequent hereditary cancers.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The bioanalytical and bioinformatics pipeline was validated on a set of internal and commercially available DNA controls showing high coverage uniformity, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

The Morris water maze test (MWM) is a useful tool to evaluate rodents’ spatial learning and memory, but the outcome is susceptible to various experimental conditions. Thigmotaxis is a commonly observed behavioral pattern which is thought to be related to anxiety or fear. This behavior is associated with prolonged escape latency, but the impact of its frequency in the early stage on the final outcome is not clearly understood. We analyzed swim path trajectories in male C57BL/6 mice with or without bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis. As the next step, we made a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize the swim path trajectories. Our model could distinguish thigmotaxis from other trajectories with 96% accuracy and specificity as high as 0.98. These results suggest that thigmotaxis in the early training stage is a predictive factor for impaired performance in MWM, and machine learning can detect such behavior easily and automatically.</content></content><title>Recognition of early stage thigmotaxis in Morris water maze test with convolutional neural network</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af6:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akinori Higaki, Masaki Mogi, Jun Iwanami, Li-Juan Min, Hui-Yu Bai, Bao-Shuai Shan, Harumi Kan-no, Shuntaro Ikeda, Jitsuo Higaki, Masatsugu Horiuchi&lt;/p&gt;

There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis. As the next step, we made a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize the swim path trajectories. Our model could distinguish thigmotaxis from other trajectories with 96% accuracy and specificity as high as 0.98. These results suggest that thigmotaxis in the early training stage is a predictive factor for impaired performance in MWM, and machine learning can detect such behavior easily and automatically.</description><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><fingerprint>262e7aa2</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197003</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197003</originId><published>1525381200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197003</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Alejandro Bilbao, Amar K.

The relative age effect (RAE; i.e., an asymmetry in the birth distribution) is a bias observed in sport competitions that may favour relatively older athletes in talent identification. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RAE in elite soccer players competing in the Italian championships, even considering the discriminations of younger and older &lt;i&gt;Serie A&lt;/i&gt; players (in relation to the median age of the sample), and different positional roles (i.e., goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, forward) for each observed category. A total of 2051 players competing into the 2017–2018 Italian under-15 (n = 265), under-16 (n = 362), under-17 (n = 403), &lt;i&gt;Primavera&lt;/i&gt; (n = 421) and &lt;i&gt;Serie A&lt;/i&gt; (n = 600) championships were analysed. The birth-date distributions, grouped in four quartiles (i.e., January-March, Q1; April-June, Q2; July-September, Q3; October-December, Q4), were compared to a uniform distribution using Chi-squared analysis. The week of birth was analysed using Poisson regression. The results showed a large over-representation of players born in Q1 in all soccer player categories. However, the effect size of this trend resulted smaller as age increased. Individuals born in Q1 have about two-folds more chances to become a &lt;i&gt;Serie A&lt;/i&gt; player compared to those born in Q4. The Poisson regression analysis showed that RAE was greater for defenders than for forwards among all categories. Therefore, a strongly biased selection emerged among elite soccer players competing in Italian championships, highlighting how young individuals born in the first three months have many more chances to become elite players compared to the others.</content></content><title>The relative age effect is larger in Italian soccer top-level youth categories and smaller in &amp;lt;i&gt;Serie A&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7905:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paolo Riccardo Brustio, Corrado Lupo, Alexandru Nicolae Ungureanu, Riccardo Frati, Alberto Rainoldi, Gennaro Boccia&lt;/p&gt;

Not because it’s useful – that’s already known – but because it can explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b00270&quot;&gt;Here’s the paper&lt;/a&gt; (from UC-Irvine and Amgen), and the compound is the 4-azido derivative of phenylalanine. Interestingly, the authors were not trying to investigate its hazards, but were after an easier, safer, and cheaper synthetic route. They succeeded, by the way, along with providing some valuable reference work about how to determine its chiral purity and also (re)establishing a poorly characterized coupling reagent (Boc-Oxyma) as a useful species. Now, some people will look at this target compound and say “Well, yeah, sure, azide”, but organoazides are not all explosive. The lower the molecular weight, the more likely you are to run into trouble, but there are smaller azides than this one that still aren’t a problem to handle. I’ll say right off that I don’t know of any incidents with azido-Phe, which is a good thing, but the data in this paper suggest that such an incident is certainly possible. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns about the synthetic routes to this compound, I should note, is the presence of an azide ion / copper combination. It is a very solid general rule to avoid the formation of any transition-metal or heavy-metal azide species; they should all be considered explosion hazards (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/08/28/mercury_azides_ill_get_right_on_those_for_you&quot;&gt;“Things I Won’t Work With” reference&lt;/a&gt;, for emphasis). Want some more backing for that statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The sensitivity of dry cupric azide to friction is so great that it is prone to explosion &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/257189.pdf&quot;&gt;during its removal&lt;/a&gt; from filter paper. Copper(I) azide (cuprous azide) is similarly perilous, and explosions have been reported for this complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.19110244402&quot;&gt;while completely submerged&lt;/a&gt; in water and after being lightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/257189.pdf&quot;&gt;touched with a feather&lt;/a&gt; in open air. An intelligence bulletin from The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health warned in 1976 that several explosions had occurred in the United States and Canada, apparently resulting from the accumulation of heavy-metal azides in hospital plumbing. These events were likely due to the routine disposal of NaN3-laced waste from automatic blood cell counting machines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/78-127/78127_13.html&quot;&gt;directly into hospital drains&lt;/a&gt;. Since many of these incidents occurred while attempting to clear a blocked pipe, it seems unlikely that any metal azides present were dry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said the manuscript, dryly. So no, I don’t think we’ll be wanting any copper azide species if that can be helped (the covalent azides used in the copper-catalyzed “click” reaction are a different thing altogether). Since this new synthesis does still involve a copper-catalyzed azide formation, the authors carefully investigated the material in each step for explosion hazards. The good news is that none of the intermediates (nor the precipitates formed) seem to be hazardous. The bad news is that the final product is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was determined through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a technique where a (small!) sample is heated to increasing temperatures and monitored for excess heat being given off (exothermic decomposition), and its partner technique, accelerating-rate calorimetry (ARC). What these show is that the N-Boc derivative of azido-Phe is possibly a cause for concern, but the unprotected species is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; a problem. Its calorimetric behavior is similar to that of a high explosive, and it appears as if it could be shock-sensitive as well. I would say that this problem is unappreciated in the chemical literature, and it’s a good thing that no one discovered this the hard way. Perhaps a salt of the compound has better behavior and would be a safer reagent and article of commerce?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Alveolar epithelial cells are critical to the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which are associated with overexpression of type 2 cytokine IL-13. IL-13 is known to induce the production of profibrotic (e.g., periostin) and pro-inflammatory (e.g., eotaxin-3) mediators in human airway epithelial cells, but it remains unclear if human primary alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression following IL-13 stimulation. The goals of this study are to determine if alveolar epithelial cells increase periostin and eotaxin expression upon IL-13 stimulation, and if alveolar and airway epithelial cells from the same subjects have similar responses to IL-13. Paired alveolar and airway epithelial cells were isolated from donors without any lung disease, and cultured under submerged or air-liquid interface conditions with or without IL-13. Up-regulation of periostin protein and mRNA was observed in IL-13-stimulated alveolar epithelial cells, which was comparable to that in IL-13-stimulated paired airway epithelial cells. IL-13 also increased eotaxin-3 expression in alveolar epithelial cells, but the level of eotaxin mRNA was lower in alveolar epithelial cells than in airway epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that human alveolar epithelial cells are able to produce periostin and eotaxin in responses to IL-13 stimulation. This study suggests the need to further determine the contribution of alveolar epithelial cell-derived mediators to pulmonary fibrosis.</content></content><title>IL-13 induces periostin and eotaxin expression in human primary alveolar epithelial cells: Comparison with paired airway epithelial cells</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935cf:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoko Ito, Reem Al Mubarak, Nicole Roberts, Kelly Correll, William Janssen, James Finigan, Rangnath Mishra, Hong Wei Chu&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings show that the structure of the human mutant FI-Prion, responsible for Sporadic Fatal Insomnia is more flexible than the native human form PrPnat. Specific regions of the mutant seem to fluctuate more freely than the corresponding loops in the native form.

Nitrogen assimilation and metabolism are essential processes for all living organisms, yet there is still much to be learnt on how they are regulated. The use of &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; as a model system has been instrumental not only in identifying conserved regulation mechanisms that control the nitrogen assimilation pathway, but also in understanding how the intracellular nitrogen status regulates metabolic processes of industrial interest such as the synthesis of biolipids. While the genetic regulators that control the nitrogen pathway are successfully being unravelled, other layers of regulation have received less attention. Amino acids, for example, regulate nitrogen assimilation in certain organisms, but their role in Chlamydomonas has not thoroughly been explored. Previous results had suggested that arginine might repress key genes of the nitrogen assimilation pathway by acting within the ammonium negative signalling cascade, upstream of the nitric oxide (NO) inducible guanylate cyclase &lt;i&gt;CYG56&lt;/i&gt;. We tested this hypothesis with a combination of genetic and chemical approaches. Antagonising the effects of arginine with an arginine biosynthesis mutant or with two chemical analogues released gene expression from ammonium mediated repression. The &lt;i&gt;cyg56&lt;/i&gt; and related &lt;i&gt;non1&lt;/i&gt; mutants, which are partially insensitive to ammonium repression, were also partially insensitive to repression by arginine. Finally, we show that the addition of arginine to the medium leads to an increase in intracellular NO. Our data reveal that arginine acts as a negative signal for the assimilation of nitrogen within the ammonium-CYG56 negative signalling cascade, and provide a connection between amino acid metabolism and nitrogen assimilation in microalgae.</content></content><title>Arginine is a component of the ammonium-CYG56 signalling cascade that represses genes of the nitrogen assimilation pathway in &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb99:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by David González-Ballester, Emanuel Sanz-Luque, Aurora Galván, Emilio Fernández, Amaury de Montaigu&lt;/p&gt;

Accordingly, to effectively assess the performance of metagenomic analysis software, a wide range of benchmark data sets are required. Here, we describe the CAMISIM microbial community and metagenome simulator. The software can model different microbial abundance profiles, multi-sample time series and differential abundance studies, includes real and simulated strain-level diversity, and generates second and third generation sequencing data from taxonomic profiles or de novo. Gold standards are created for sequence assembly, genome binning, taxonomic binning, and taxonomic profiling. CAMSIM generated the benchmark data sets of the first CAMI challenge. For two simulated multi-sample data sets of the human and mouse gut microbiomes we observed high functional congruence to the real data. As further applications, we investigated the effect of varying evolutionary genome divergence, sequencing depth, and read error profiles on two popular metagenome assemblers, MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes, on several thousand small data sets generated with CAMISIM.

Accordingly, to effectively assess the performance of metagenomic analysis software, a wide range of benchmark data sets are required. Here, we describe the CAMISIM microbial community and metagenome simulator. The software can model different microbial abundance profiles, multi-sample time series and differential abundance studies, includes real and simulated strain-level diversity, and generates second and third generation sequencing data from taxonomic profiles or de novo. Gold standards are created for sequence assembly, genome binning, taxonomic binning, and taxonomic profiling. CAMSIM generated the benchmark data sets of the first CAMI challenge. For two simulated multi-sample data sets of the human and mouse gut microbiomes we observed high functional congruence to the real data. As further applications, we investigated the effect of varying evolutionary genome divergence, sequencing depth, and read error profiles on two popular metagenome assemblers, MEGAHIT and metaSPAdes, on several thousand small data sets generated with CAMISIM. CAMISIM can simulate a wide variety of microbial communities and metagenome data sets together with truth standards for method evaluation.

NAC proteins are a family of transcription factors which have a variety of important regulatory roles in plants. They present a very well conserved group of NAC subdomains in the N-terminal region and a highly variable domain at the C-terminus. Currently, knowledge concerning NAC family in the strawberry plant remains very limited. In this work, we analyzed the NAC family of &lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;, and a total of 112 NAC proteins were identified after we curated the annotations from the version 4.0.a1 genome. They were placed into the ligation groups (pseudo-chromosomes) and described its physicochemical and genetic features. A microarray transcriptomic analysis showed six of them expressed during the development and ripening of the &lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. Their expression patterns were studied in fruit (receptacle and achenes) in different stages of development and in vegetative tissues. Also, the expression level under different hormonal treatments (auxins, ABA) and drought stress was investigated. In addition, they were clustered with other NAC transcription factor with known function related to growth and development, senescence, fruit ripening, stress response, and secondary cell wall and vascular development. Our results indicate that these six strawberry NAC proteins could play different important regulatory roles in the process of development and ripening of the fruit, providing the basis for further functional studies and the selection for NAC candidates suitable for biotechnological applications.</content></content><title>Genome-wide analysis of the NAC transcription factor family and their expression during the development and ripening of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Fragaria&amp;lt;/i&gt; × &amp;lt;i&gt;ananassa&amp;lt;/i&gt; fruits</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af4:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enriqueta Moyano, Félix J.

Our findings have revealed that by boosting the applied field one induces changes in the occupation numbers of molecular orbitals, giving rise to changes in the equilibrium geometry and in the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. Specifically, singlet to triplet spin transition can be induced by increasing the applied electric field beyond a critical value.

and ) under static applied electric field is performed at CCSD(T), DFT, MRCI and MRCI(Q) levels of theory. Our findings have revealed that by boosting the applied field one induces changes in the occupation numbers of molecular orbitals, giving rise to changes in the equilibrium geometry and in the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. Specifically, singlet to triplet spin transition can be induced by increasing the applied electric field beyond a critical value. Accordingly, affecting the accuracy of the widely used expression of energy expanded in Taylor series with respect to the applied electric field. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><crawled>1524226167189</crawled><fingerprint>e010e208</fingerprint><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25229?af=R</originId><published>1524223564000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1525381200000</updated><author><name>Rebecca L.

The rickettsiae are obligate intracellular alphaproteobacteria that exhibit a complex infectious life cycle in both arthropod and mammalian hosts. As obligate intracellular bacteria, rickettsiae are highly adapted to living inside a variety of host cells, including vascular endothelial cells during mammalian infection. Although it is assumed that the rickettsiae produce numerous virulence factors that usurp or disrupt various host cell pathways, they have been challenging to genetically manipulate to identify the key bacterial factors that contribute to infection. Motivated to overcome this challenge, we sought to expand the repertoire of available rickettsial loss-of-function mutants, using an improved &lt;i&gt;mariner&lt;/i&gt;-based transposon mutagenesis scheme. Here, we present the isolation of over 100 transposon mutants in the spotted fever group species &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia parkeri&lt;/i&gt;. Transposon insertions disrupted genes whose products are implicated in a variety of pathways, including bacterial replication and metabolism, the type IV secretion system, factors with previously established roles in host cell interactions and pathogenesis, or are of unknown function. Given the need to identify critical virulence factors, forward genetic screens such as this will provide an excellent platform to more directly investigate rickettsial biology and pathogenesis.</content></content><title>A streamlined method for transposon mutagenesis of &amp;lt;i&gt;Rickettsia parkeri&amp;lt;/i&gt; yields numerous mutations that impact infection</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af8:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are located in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene, are reported to be associated with body weight and the body mass index (BMI). However, their effects on anthropometric measurements in adolescents are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the association of three adjacent polymorphisms (rs9930506, rs9930501, &amp;amp; rs9932754) in the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene with anthropometric indices in Iranian adolescent males.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The participants comprised a total of 237 adolescent males who were recruited randomly from two high schools in Tehran, Iran. The DNA samples were genotyped for the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms by DNA sequencing. BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), and body muscle percentage (BM%) were determined using a validated bioelectrical impedance analysis scale. The association of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms with weight, height, BMI, BF%, and BM% was investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A haplotype of rs9930506, rs9930501, and rs9932754 (GGT) in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; with complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found to be significantly associated with higher weight (OR = 1.32), BMI (OR = 5.36) and BF% (OR = 1.46), and lower BM% (OR = 3.59) (all P&amp;lt;0.001). None of the students with GGC genotypes were underweight, while all of the students with AAT genotypes had high muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A haplotype in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene had a strong association with obesity indices in Iranian adolescent males. The &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms might have greater effects on anthropometric indices than what was previously imagined. Moreover, we suggested that the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene exerted their effects on anthropometric measurements through haplotypes (and not single SNPs).&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>A haplotype of three SNPs in &amp;lt;i&gt;FTO&amp;lt;/i&gt; had a strong association with body composition and BMI in Iranian male adolescents</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f6:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naser Kalantari, Nastaran Keshavarz Mohammadi, Pantea Izadi, Saeid Doaei, Maryam Gholamalizadeh, Hassan Eini-Zinab, Tuire Salonurmi, Shahram Rafieifar, Reza Janipoor, Ghasem Azizi Tabesh&lt;/p&gt;

The DNA samples were genotyped for the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms by DNA sequencing. BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), and body muscle percentage (BM%) were determined using a validated bioelectrical impedance analysis scale. The association of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms with weight, height, BMI, BF%, and BM% was investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A haplotype of rs9930506, rs9930501, and rs9932754 (GGT) in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; with complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found to be significantly associated with higher weight (OR = 1.32), BMI (OR = 5.36) and BF% (OR = 1.46), and lower BM% (OR = 3.59) (all P&amp;lt;0.001). None of the students with GGC genotypes were underweight, while all of the students with AAT genotypes had high muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A haplotype in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene had a strong association with obesity indices in Iranian adolescent males. The &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms might have greater effects on anthropometric indices than what was previously imagined. Moreover, we suggested that the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene exerted their effects on anthropometric measurements through haplotypes (and not single SNPs).&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><fingerprint>69c40968</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195589</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195589</originId><published>1524258000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195589</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>2</engagement><author><name>Fei Lu, Huifeng Hu, Wenjuan Sun, Jiaojun Zhu, Guobin Liu, Wangming Zhou, Quanfa Zhang, Peili Shi, Xiuping Liu, Xing Wu, Lu Zhang, Xiaohua Wei, Limin Dai, Kerong Zhang, Yirong Sun, Sha Xue, Wanjun Zhang, Dingpeng Xiong, Lei Deng, Bojie Liu, Li Zhou, Chao Zhang, Xiao Zheng, Jiansheng Cao, Yao Huang, Nianpeng He, Guoyi Zhou, Yongfei Bai, Zongqiang Xie, Zhiyao Tang, Bingfang Wu, Jingyun Fang, Guohua Liu, Guirui Yu</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4039.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The long-term stressful utilization of forests and grasslands has led to ecosystem degradation and C loss.

The main objective of this work was to quantify and update the U.S. Midwest agricultural state of Iowa’s contribution of nitrate-nitrogen to the Mississippi River stream network against the backdrop of the ongoing problem of Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. To achieve this objective, we used stream nitrate and discharge data collected from 1999 until 2016 at 23 Iowa stream sites near watershed outlets, along with publicly-available data for sites downstream of Iowa on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Our analysis shows that Iowa contributes between 11 and 52% of the long-term nitrate load to the Mississippi-Atchafalaya Basin, 20 to 63% to the Upper Mississippi River Basin, and 20 to 89% to the Missouri River Basin, with averages of 29, 45 and 55% respectively. Since 1999, nitrate loads in the Iowa-inclusive basins have increased and these increases do not appear to be driven by changes in discharge and cropping intensity unique to Iowa. The 5-year running annual average of Iowa nitrate loading has been above the 2003 level for ten consecutive years, implying that Gulf hypoxic areal goals, also based on a 5-year running annual average, will be very difficult to achieve if nitrate retention cannot be improved in Iowa. An opportunity exists for land managers, policy makers and conservationists to manifest a positive effect on water quality by targeting and implementing nitrate reducing-practices in areas like Iowa while avoiding areas that are less likely to affect Gulf of Mexico hypoxia.</content></content><title>Iowa stream nitrate and the Gulf of Mexico</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66db:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher S.

Neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are apicobasally elongated and densely packed in the developing brain, systematically move their nuclei/somata in a cell cycle–dependent manner, called interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM): apical during G2 and basal during G1. Although intracellular molecular mechanisms of individual IKNM have been explored, how heterogeneous IKNMs are collectively coordinated is unknown. Our quantitative cell-biological and in silico analyses revealed that tissue elasticity mechanically assists an initial step of basalward IKNM. When the soma of an M-phase progenitor cell rounds up using actomyosin within the subapical space, a microzone within 10 μm from the surface, which is compressed and elastic because of the apical surface’s contractility, laterally pushes the densely neighboring processes of non–M-phase cells. The pressed processes then recoil centripetally and basally to propel the nuclei/somata of the progenitor’s daughter cells. Thus, indirect neighbor-assisted transfer of mechanical energy from mother to daughter helps efficient brain development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QIHSf4hXHfg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Elasticity-based boosting of neuroepithelial nucleokinesis via indirect energy transfer from mother to daughter</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162e4278028:4dbf10:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoyasu Shinoda, Arata Nagasaka, Yasuhiro Inoue, Ryo Higuchi, Yoshiaki Minami, Kagayaki Kato, Makoto Suzuki, Takefumi Kondo, Takumi Kawaue, Kanako Saito, Naoto Ueno, Yugo Fukazawa, Masaharu Nagayama, Takashi Miura, Taiji Adachi, Takaki Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings challenge the feasibility of &apos;shock and kill&apos;, and suggest the need to explore other strategies to control the latent HIV reservoir.</description><crawled>1525175811009</crawled><fingerprint>14cfe342</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34655</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><published>1525132800000</published><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34655</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34655</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04156-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suspected chemical attack, opioid-crisis cash and nuclear-fusion facility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspected chemical attack, opioid-crisis cash and nuclear-fusion facility, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04156-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04156-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The week in science: 6–12 April 2018.</content></content><title>Suspected chemical attack, opioid-crisis cash and nuclear-fusion facility</title><crawled>1523448816772</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04156-7</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162b4a02484:54e3d7:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suspected chemical attack, opioid-crisis cash and nuclear-fusion facility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspected chemical attack, opioid-crisis cash and nuclear-fusion facility, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04156-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04156-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The week in science: 6–12 April 2018.</description><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>920bf599</fingerprint><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04156-7</originId><published>1523430000000</published><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04156-7/d41586-018-04156-7_15603270.jpg</url><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524171600000</updated><author><name>Erik Ising</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196243</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Erik Ising, Lars B.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To investigate whether multi-frequency vibrometry can identify individuals with elevated vibration perception thresholds (VPTs), reflecting impaired vibrotactile sense, among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 72 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, VPTs were evaluated for seven frequencies on two sites of the hand, and five frequencies on two sites of the foot. Z-scores, based on previously collected reference data, were calculated. Perception to light touch was investigated using monofilaments. Subjects’ characteristics were analyzed in comparison to normal and impaired vibrotactile sense.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Subjects’ median age, disease duration and age at disease onset were 12.8, 5.3 and 6.9 years, respectively. A total of 13 out of 72 (18%) subjects had impaired vibrotactile sense on at least one foot site. Impaired vibrotactile sense was more common among subjects treated with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) compared to subjects treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (p = 0.013). Age at disease onset was higher among subjects with impaired vibrotactile sense (p = 0.046). No significant correlations were found with gender, HbA1c or duration of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Impaired vibrotactile sense, mirroring diabetic peripheral neuropathy, was found in 1/5 of the children and adolescents in the study, and was more common in patients treated with MDI than in subjects treated with CSII.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Impaired vibrotactile sense in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes – Signs of peripheral neuropathy</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7903:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erik Ising, Lars B.

Phycobilisomes (PBS) are accessory light harvesting protein complexes formed mainly by phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The PBPs absorb light that is efficiently transferred to Photosystems due to chromophores covalently bound to specific cysteine residues. Besides phycobiliproteins (PE), the PBS contains linker proteins responsible for assembly and stabilization of the whole complex and the tuning of energy transfer steps between chromophores. The linker (γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria chilensis&lt;/i&gt;, is a chromophorylated rod linker associated to (αβ)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; hexamers of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE). Its role in the energy transfer process is not clear yet. Structural studies as well as the composition and location of the chromophores are essential to understand their involvement in the energy transfer process in PBS. To achieve this, the coding gene of γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was analyzed by informatics tools, to obtain preliminary information which leaded the next experiments. The protein was purified from R-phycoerythrin, and the sequence confirmed by mass spectrometry. The coding sequence analysis revealed a protein of 318 aminoacid residues containing a chloroplastidial transit peptide (cTP) of 39 aminoacids at the N-terminus. The conservation of cysteines revealed possible chromophorylation sites. Using α and β R-PE subunits as spectroscopic probes in denaturation assays, we deduced a double bonded phycourobilin (PUB) on γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; subunit that were confirmed between Cys62 and Cys73 (DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;62/73&lt;/sup&gt;) by mass spectrometry. The cysteines involved in the double link are located in a helical region, in a conformation that reminds the position of the DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;50/61&lt;/sup&gt; in the β subunit of R-PE. The position of single linked PUB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt; and a single linked PEB at Cys&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; were also confirmed.

The highly similar prokaryotic DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (C5-MTases) M.MpeI and M.SssI share the specificity of eukaryotic C5-MTases (5’-CG), and can be useful research tools in the study of eukaryotic DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation. In an effort to improve the stability and solubility of complementing fragments of the two MTases, genes encoding circularly permuted (CP) variants of M.MpeI and M.SssI were created, and cloned in a plasmid vector downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter. MTase activity of the CP variants was tested by digestion of the plasmids with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Eleven of the fourteen M.MpeI permutants and six of the seven M.SssI permutants had detectable MTase activity as indicated by the full or partial protection of the plasmid carrying the cpMTase gene. Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work.</content></content><title>Circularly permuted variants of two CG-specific prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915b:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pál Albert, Bence Varga, Nikolett Zsibrita, Antal Kiss&lt;/p&gt;

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern. However, very little data is available on prevalence of these bacteria in surface water throughout a watershed. This study aimed to characterize &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; present in the Upper Oconee Watershed, a mixed-use watershed in Athens, GA, USA for potential pathogenicity and AR. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; were enumerated by colony counts, cultured by enrichment and direct plating, and characterized by phylo-groups, diarrheagenic pathotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility. From the analysis, 99.3% (455/458) of the total samples were positive for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resulting in 496 isolates. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; counts were as high as 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/100 ml, which is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) threshold for recreational water (235 CFU/100 ml based on a one-time measurement). Phylo-groups B2 (31.7%; 157/496) and B1 (30.8%; 153/496) were the most prevalent among the isolates. Enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) (19/496) and Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) (1/496) were the only diarrheagenic pathotypes detected. AR was observed in 6.9% (34/496) of the isolates, 15 of which were multidrug resistant (MDR; resistance to two or more classes of antimicrobials). Tetracycline resistance was most often detected (76.5%; 26/34), followed by ampicillin (32.4%; 11/34), streptomycin (23.5%; 8/34), sulfisoxazole (23.5%; 8/34), and nalidixic acid (14.7%; 5/34). Results from this study showed that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; is prevalent in high levels in the Upper Oconee Watershed, suggesting possible widespread fecal contamination.

A consistent determinant of the establishment success of alien species appears to be the number of individuals that are introduced to found a population (propagule pressure), yet variation in the form of this relationship has been largely unexplored. Here, we present the first quantitative systematic review of this form, using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success has been evaluated for a broad range of taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants and long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. We found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success to be a feature of every hypothesis we tested. However, establishment success most critically depended on propagule pressures in the range of 10–100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. Conversely, no variation was accounted for in any analysis by the scale of study (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used. Our analyses reveal remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7aUJblC5EI4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Dissecting the null model for biological invasions: A meta-analysis of the propagule pressure effect</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f3ad5b12:38e8b5:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Phillip Cassey, Steven Delean, Julie L.

As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>a580317b</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/627.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Physics</item></keywords><published>1525974002000</published><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/627?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/627?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Two proteins required for the growth of a skin-like structure called the tegument in parasitic flatworms could be new targets for drugs to kill these parasites.</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>cea88@cornell.edu (Carolyn E Adler)</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36813</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Dissecting the schistosome cloak</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36813</link><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163077dbb9d:ac213e:fc1f8953</id><description>Two proteins required for the growth of a skin-like structure called the tegument in parasitic flatworms could be new targets for drugs to kill these parasites.</description><crawled>1524839070621</crawled><fingerprint>b1774f56</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36813</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><published>1524528000000</published><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36813</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Souza, J.

Dietary intake of barley β-glucan (BG) is known to affect energy metabolism. However, its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood because studies have presented inconsistent results, with both positive and negative effects reported in terms of satiety, energy intake, weight loss, and glycemic control. The objective of this study was to clarify the physiological role underlying the metabolic benefits of barley BG using a mouse model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Male 4-wk-old C57BL/6J mice were fed an HFD with 20% barley flour containing either high BG (HBG; 2% BG) or low BG (LBG; 0.6% BG) levels under conventional and germ-free (GF) conditions for 12 wks. In addition, mice were fed either an HFD with 5% cellulose (HFC; high fiber cellulose) or 5% barley BG (HFB; high fiber β-glucan) for 12 wks. Then, metabolic parameters, gut microbial compositions, and the production of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were analyzed. The weight gain and fat mass of HBG-fed mice were lower than those of control mice at 16-wk-old. Moreover, the secretion of the gut hormones PYY and GLP-1 increased in HBG-fed mice, thereby reducing food intake and improving insulin sensitivity by changing the gut microbiota and increasing SCFAs (especially, butyrate) under conventional condition. These effects in HBG-fed mice were abolished under GF conditions. Moreover, the HFB diets also increased PYY and GLP-1 secretion, and decreased food intake compared with that in HFC-fed mice. These results suggest that the beneficial metabolic effects of barley BG are primary due to the suppression of appetite and improvement of insulin sensitivity, which are induced by gut hormone secretion promoted via gut microbiota-produced SCFAs.</content></content><title>Barley β-glucan improves metabolic condition via short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbial fermentation in high fat diet fed mice</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7e:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junki Miyamoto, Keita Watanabe, Satsuki Taira, Mayu Kasubuchi, Xuan Li, Junichiro Irie, Hiroshi Itoh, Ikuo Kimura&lt;/p&gt;

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) that are symbiotically associated with &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Photorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria can kill target insects via direct infection and toxin action. There are limited reports identifying such organisms in the National Park of Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify EPNs and symbiotic bacteria from Nam Nao National Park, Phetchabun Province, Thailand and to evaluate the larvicidal activity of bacteria against &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 12 EPN isolates belonging to &lt;i&gt;Steinernema&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heterorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; were obtained form 940 soil samples between February 2014 and July 2016. EPNs were molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;websteri&lt;/i&gt; (10 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates). Symbiotic bacteria were isolated from EPNs and molecularly identified as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (13 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (11 isolates), &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; (2 isolates) and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;japonica&lt;/i&gt; (1 isolate). For the bioassay, bacterial suspensions were evaluated for toxicity against third to early fourth instar larvae of &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; spp. The larvae of both &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species were orally susceptible to symbiotic bacteria. The highest larval mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; was 99% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; (bNN112.3_TH) at 96 h, and the highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was 98% after exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; (bNN121.4_TH) at 96 h. In contrast to the control groups (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and distilled water), the mortality rate of both mosquito larvae ranged between 0 and 7% at 72 h. Here, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vietnamensis&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. Additionally, we report the first observation of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;luminescens&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;akhurstii&lt;/i&gt; associated with &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baujardi&lt;/i&gt; in Thailand. &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stockiae&lt;/i&gt; has potential to be a biocontrol agent for mosquitoes.

Background &lt;p&gt;We investigated the effects of multiple-modality exercise with additional mind-motor training on cognition in community-dwelling older adults with subjective cognitive complaints.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants (n = 127, mean age 67.5 [7.3] years, 71% women) were randomized to receive 45 minutes of multiple-modality exercise with additional 15 minutes of either mind-motor training (M4, n = 63) or control (balance, range of motion and breathing exercises [M2, n = 64]). In total, both groups exercised 60 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 24 weeks. Standardized global cognitive functioning (GCF), concentration, reasoning, planning, and memory were assessed at 24 weeks and after a 28-week no-contact follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in the study primary outcomes. The M4 group, however, showed trends for greater improvements in GCF and memory (both, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .07) compared to the M2 group at 24 weeks. Significant differences between group in GCF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .03) and memory (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .02) were observed after the 28-week no-contact follow-up favouring the M4 group.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Additional mind-motor training did not impart immediate greater benefits to cognition among the study participants.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Cognitive changes following multiple-modality exercise and mind-motor training in older adults with subjective cognitive complaints: The M4 study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae69:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Narlon Cassio Boa Sorte Silva, Dawn P.

From 2006 to 2013, an increasing incidence of fusariosis was observed in the hematologic patients of our University Hospital. We suspected of an environmental source, and the indoor hospital air was investigated as a potential source of the fungemia. Air samplings were performed in the hematology and bone marrow transplant (BMT) wards using an air sampler with pre-defined air volumes. To study the molecular relationship among environmental and clinical isolates, 18 &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; spp. recovered from blood cultures were included in the study. DNA sequencing of a partial portion of &lt;i&gt;TEF1α&lt;/i&gt; gene was performed for molecular identification. Molecular typing was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) using a four-gene scheme: &lt;i&gt;TEF1α&lt;/i&gt;, rDNA, &lt;i&gt;RPB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RPB2&lt;/i&gt;. One hundred four isolates were recovered from the air of the hematology (n = 76) and the BMT (n = 28) wards. &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; isolates from the air were from five species complexes: &lt;i&gt;Fusarium fujikuroi&lt;/i&gt; (FFSC, n = 56), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti&lt;/i&gt; (FIESC, n = 24), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium solani&lt;/i&gt; (FSSC, n = 13), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium chlamydosporum&lt;/i&gt; (FCSC, n = 10), and &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; (FOSC, n = 1). Fifteen &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from blood belonged to FSSC, and three to FFSC. MLST identified the same sequence type (ST) in clinical and environmental isolates. ST1 was found in 5 isolates from blood and in 7 from the air, both identified as FSSC (&lt;i&gt;Fusarium petroliphilum&lt;/i&gt;). STn1 was found in one isolate from blood and in one from the air, both identified as FFSC (&lt;i&gt;Fusarium napiforme&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;napiforme&lt;/i&gt; was isolated from the air of the hospital room of the patient with fungemia due to &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;napiforme&lt;/i&gt;. These findings suggested a possible clonal origin of the &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; spp. recovered from air and bloodcultures. In conclusion, our study found a diversity of &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species in the air of our hospital, and a possible role of the air as source of systemic fusariosis in our immunocompromised patients.</content></content><title>Airborne transmission of invasive fusariosis in patients with hematologic malignancies</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae70:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Luiza Moretti, Ariane Fidelis Busso-Lopes, Cibele Aparecida Tararam, Renato Moraes, Yasunori Muraosa, Yuzuru Mikami, Tohru Gonoi, Hideaki Taguchi, Luzia Lyra, Franqueline Reichert-Lima, Plínio Trabasso, Gerrit Sybren de Hoog, Abdullah Mohammed Said Al-Hatmi, Angelica Zaninelli Schreiber, Katsuhiko Kamei&lt;/p&gt;

The macaque is widely accepted as a suitable model for preclinical characterization of dengue vaccine candidates. However, the only vaccine for which both preclinical and clinical efficacy results were reported so far showed efficacy levels that were substantially different between macaques and humans. We hypothesized that this model’s predictive capacity may be improved using recent and minimally passaged dengue virus isolates, and by assessing vaccine efficacy by characterizing not only the post-dengue virus challenge viremia/RNAemia but also the associated-cytokine profile. Ten recent and minimally passaged Brazilian clinical isolates from the four dengue virus serotypes were tested for their infectivity in rhesus macaques. For the strains showing robust replication capacity, the associated-changes in soluble mediator levels, and the elicited dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses, were also characterized. Three isolates from dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 4 induced viremia of high magnitude and longer duration relative to previously reported viremia kinetics in this model, and robust dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses. Consistent with observations in humans, increased MCP-1, IFN-γ and VEGF-A levels, and transiently decreased IL-8 levels were detected after infection with the selected isolates. These results may contribute to establishing a dengue macaque model showing a higher predictability for vaccine efficacy in humans.</content></content><title>Characterization of recent and minimally passaged Brazilian dengue viruses inducing robust infection in rhesus macaques</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67bb:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Beatriz Borges, Renato Sergio Marchevsky, Ygara S.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The inconclusive clinical results for ST-waveform analysis (STAN) in detecting fetal hypoxemia may be caused by the signal processing of the STAN-device itself. We assessed the performance of a clinical STAN device in signal processing and in detecting hypoxemia in a fetal sheep model exposed to prolonged umbilical cord occlusion (UCO).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight fetal lambs were exposed to 25 minutes of UCO. ECG recordings were analyzed during a baseline period and during UCO. STAN-event rates and timing of episodic T/QRS rise, baseline T/QRS rise and the occurrence of biphasic ST-waveforms, as well as signal loss, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During baseline conditions of normoxemia, a median of 40 (IQR, 25–70) STAN-events per minute were detected, compared to 10 (IQR, 2–22) during UCO. During UCO STAN-events were detected in five subjects within 10 minutes and in six subjects after 18 minutes, respectively. Two subjects did not generate any STAN-event during UCO. Biphasic ST event rate was reduced during UCO (median 0, IQR 0–5), compared to baseline (median 32, IQR, 6–55). ST-waveforms could not be assessed in 62% of the recording time during UCO, despite a good quality of the ECG signal.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The STAN device showed limitations in detecting hypoxemia in fetal sheep after prolonged UCO. The STAN device produced high false positive event rates during baseline and did not detect T/QRS changes adequately after prolonged fetal hypoxemia. During 14% of baseline and 62% of the UCO period, the STAN-device could not process the ECG signal, despite its good quality. Resolving these issues may improve the clinical performance of the STAN device.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>ST waveform analysis for monitoring hypoxic distress in fetal sheep after prolonged umbilical cord occlusion</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7aef:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Andriessen, Alex Zwanenburg, Judith O.

Aims &lt;p&gt;Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), secreted primarily by atrial cardiomyocytes, decreases blood pressure by raising cyclic 3’,5’-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels and inducing vasorelaxation, natriuresis, and diuresis. Raising the level of ANP has been shown to be an effective treatment for hypertension. To advance the future development of an anti-microRNA (miR) approach to increasing expression of ANP, we investigated the regulation of &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression by two miRs: miR-425 and miR-155. We examined whether miR-425 and miR-155 have an additive effect on the expression and function of ANP.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) were transfected with miR-425, miR-155, or a combination of the two miRs. Two days later, &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was measured using real time qPCR. Each of the miRs decreased &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression over a wide range of concentrations, with a significant reduction at concentrations as low as 1 nM. The combination of miR-425 and miR-155 reduced &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression to a greater extent than either miR-425 or miR-155 alone. An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay was developed to study the potential biological significance of the miR-induced decrease in &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression. The cooperative effect of miR-425 and miR-155 on &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression was associated with a significant decrease in cGMP levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that miR-425 and miR-155 regulate &lt;i&gt;NPPA&lt;/i&gt; expression in a cooperative manner.

Bittersweet (&lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&lt;/i&gt;) is a native Old World member of the nightshade family. This European diploid species can be found from marshlands to high mountainous regions and it is a common weed that serves as an alternative host and source of resistance genes against plant pathogens such as late blight (&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/i&gt;). We sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of bittersweet, which is 155,580 bp in length and it is characterized by a typical quadripartite structure composed of a large (85,901 bp) and small (18,449 bp) single-copy region interspersed by two identical inverted repeats (25,615 bp). It consists of 112 unique genes from which 81 are protein-coding, 27 tRNA and four rRNA genes. All bittersweet plastid genes including non-functional ones and even intergenic spacer regions are transcribed in primary plastid transcripts covering 95.22% of the genome. These are later substantially edited in a post-transcriptional phase to activate gene functions. By comparing the bittersweet plastid genome with all available Solanaceae sequences we found that gene content and synteny are highly conserved across the family. During genome comparison we have identified several annotation errors, which we have corrected in a manual curation process then we have identified the major plastid genome structural changes in Solanaceae. Interpreted in a phylogenetic context they seem to provide additional support for larger clades. The plastid genome sequence of bittersweet could help to benchmark Solanaceae plastid genome annotations and could be used as a reference for further studies. Such reliable annotations are important for gene diversity calculations, synteny map constructions and assigning partitions for phylogenetic analysis with de novo sequenced plastomes of Solanaceae.</content></content><title>The chloroplast genome sequence of bittersweet (&amp;lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&amp;lt;/i&gt;): Plastid genome structure evolution in Solanaceae</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67ac:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ali Amiryousefi, Jaakko Hyvönen, Péter Poczai&lt;/p&gt;

Widening the genetic basis of leaf rust resistance is a primary objective of the global durum wheat breeding effort at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Breeding programs in North America are following suit, especially after the emergence of new races of &lt;i&gt;Puccinia triticina&lt;/i&gt; such as BBG/BP and BBBQD in Mexico and the United States, respectively. This study was conducted to characterize and map previously undescribed genes for leaf rust resistance in durum wheat and to develop reliable molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding. Four recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations derived from the resistance sources Amria, Byblos, Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, which were crossed to the susceptible line ATRED #2, were evaluated for their reaction to the Mexican race BBG/BP of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;triticina&lt;/i&gt;. Genetic analyses of host reactions indicated that leaf rust resistance in these genotypes was based on major seedling resistance genes. Allelism tests among resistant parents supported that Amria and Byblos carried allelic or closely linked genes. The resistance in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 also appeared to be allelic. Bulked segregant analysis using the Infinium iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array identified two genomic regions for leaf rust resistance; one on chromosome 6BS for Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 and the other on chromosome 7BL for Amria and Byblos. Polymorphic SNPs identified within these regions were converted to kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays and used to genotype the RIL populations. KASP markers &lt;i&gt;usw215&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usw218&lt;/i&gt; were the closest to the resistance genes in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, while &lt;i&gt;usw260&lt;/i&gt; was closely linked to the resistance genes in Amria and Byblos. DNA sequences associated with these SNP markers were anchored to the wild emmer wheat (WEW) reference sequence, which identified several candidate resistance genes. The molecular markers reported herein will be useful to effectively pyramid these resistance genes with other previously marked genes into adapted, elite durum wheat genotypes.</content></content><title>Characterization and mapping of leaf rust resistance in four durum wheat cultivars</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0eb:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dhouha Kthiri, Alexander Loladze, P.

In cases of natural disasters, epidemics or even in dangerous situations like an act of terrorism, battle fields, a shooting or a mountain accident, finding survivors is a challenge. In these kind of situations it is sometimes critical to know if a person has vital signs or not, without the need to be in contact with the victim, thus avoiding jeopardizing the lives of the rescue workers. In this work, we propose the use of video magnification techniques to detect small movements in human bodies due to breathing that are invisible to the naked eye. Two different video magnification techniques, intensity-based and phase-based, were tested. The utility of these techniques to detect people who are alive but injured in risk situations was verified by simulating a scene with three people involved in an accident. Several factors such as camera stability, distance to the object, light conditions, magnification factor or computing time were analyzed. The results obtained were quite positive for both techniques, intensity-based method proving more adequate if the interest is in almost instant results whereas the phase-based method is more appropriate if processing time is not so relevant but the degree of magnification without excessive image noise.</content></content><title>Detection of human vital signs in hazardous environments by means of video magnification</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd88:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Celestino Ordóñez, Carlos Cabo, Agustín Menéndez, Antonio Bello&lt;/p&gt;

Increases of the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain generally lead to increases of production of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products. MnSOD is the first line of defense against the stress induced by mitochondrial ROS. Our previous studies demonstrated that EAE progression increased Na,K-ATPase activity in the mouse kidney cortex. Since mitochondria are the major source of ATP, our present studies were sought to determine whether EAE progression increased mitochondrial activity. We found that severe EAE increased mitochondrial complex II and IV activities without significantly affecting complex I activity with corresponding increases of ROS in the isolated mitochondria and native kidney cortex. Severe EAE augmented both cytosolic and mitochondrial MnSOD protein levels and activities and decreased the specific activity of mitochondrial MnSOD when the total mitochondrial MnSOD activity was normalized to the protein level. Using HEK293 cells as a model free of interference from immune reactions, we found that activation of Na,K-ATPase by monensin for 24 hours increased complex II activity, mitochondrial ROS and MnSOD protein abundance, and decreased the specific activity of the mitochondrial MnSOD. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase by ouabain or catalase attenuated the effects of monensin on the mitochondrial complex II activity, ROS, MnSOD protein level and specific activity. Kockdown of MnSOD by RNAi reduced the mitochondrial ability to generate ATP. In conclusion, EAE increases mitochondrial activity possibly to meet the energy demand from increased Na,K-ATPase activity. EAE increases mitochondrial MnSOD protein abundance to compensate for the loss of the specific activity of the enzyme, thus minimizing the harmful effects of ROS.</content></content><title>Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) up-regulates the mitochondrial activity and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the mouse renal cortex</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa5:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Balamurugan Packialakshmi, Xiaoming Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal mushroom that has been widely used in East Asia for the treatment of various diseases. The pharmacological activity of this fungus is primarily attributable to the polysaccharides and triterpenoids. In this study, to obtain the fruit bodies with improved content of active constituents, we examined the effect of salicylic acid (SA) and calcium ion on the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and triterpenoids by spraying the chemicals during the fruiting. To explore the underlying mechanisms for the variation, the transcripts of related genes involved in the polysaccharide and triterpenoid biosynthesis were measured. Results showed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; had no effect on production of polysaccharides and triterpenoids, whereas SA increased triterpenoid content by 23.32%, compared to the control, but it had little influence on polysaccharide production. Interestingly, the combined induction increased polysaccharide and triterpenoid content by 9.02% and 13.61%, respectively, compared to the control. Under Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induction, the transcript of &lt;i&gt;ugp&lt;/i&gt; gene in the polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway up-regulated in all three stages (mycelium, primordium, and fruit body), while &lt;i&gt;pgm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;gls&lt;/i&gt; gave no response in the mycelium and primordium stages, and up-regulated in the fruit body stage. Differently, six key triterpenoid biosynthetic genes including &lt;i&gt;hmgr&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;hmgs&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mvd&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fps&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sqs&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ls&lt;/i&gt; did not respond to the induction. In the case of SA and combined induction, &lt;i&gt;pgm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ugp&lt;/i&gt; were up-regulated in all three stages, while &lt;i&gt;gls&lt;/i&gt; showed an increased expression in the primordium stage and no response in other stages. The six triterpenoid biosynthetic genes were up-regulated in all three stages. The present study provides a useful approach to producing &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; fruit bodies with high polysaccharide and triterpenoid content. This is important to the &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; industry.</content></content><title>Enhanced production of polysaccharides and triterpenoids in &amp;lt;i&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&amp;lt;/i&gt; fruit bodies on induction with signal transduction during the fruiting stage</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7705:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liyun Ye, Shengrong Liu, Fan Xie, Lili Zhao, Xiaoping Wu&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, to obtain the fruit bodies with improved content of active constituents, we examined the effect of salicylic acid (SA) and calcium ion on the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and triterpenoids by spraying the chemicals during the fruiting. To explore the underlying mechanisms for the variation, the transcripts of related genes involved in the polysaccharide and triterpenoid biosynthesis were measured. Results showed that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; had no effect on production of polysaccharides and triterpenoids, whereas SA increased triterpenoid content by 23.32%, compared to the control, but it had little influence on polysaccharide production. Interestingly, the combined induction increased polysaccharide and triterpenoid content by 9.02% and 13.61%, respectively, compared to the control. Under Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induction, the transcript of &lt;i&gt;ugp&lt;/i&gt; gene in the polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway up-regulated in all three stages (mycelium, primordium, and fruit body), while &lt;i&gt;pgm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;gls&lt;/i&gt; gave no response in the mycelium and primordium stages, and up-regulated in the fruit body stage. Differently, six key triterpenoid biosynthetic genes including &lt;i&gt;hmgr&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;hmgs&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mvd&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fps&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sqs&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ls&lt;/i&gt; did not respond to the induction. In the case of SA and combined induction, &lt;i&gt;pgm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ugp&lt;/i&gt; were up-regulated in all three stages, while &lt;i&gt;gls&lt;/i&gt; showed an increased expression in the primordium stage and no response in other stages. The six triterpenoid biosynthetic genes were up-regulated in all three stages. The present study provides a useful approach to producing &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; fruit bodies with high polysaccharide and triterpenoid content. This is important to the &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; industry.</description><crawled>1524679026474</crawled><fingerprint>a5be15d6</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196287</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196287</originId><published>1524690000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196287</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>69</engagement><author><name>Grandgeorge, P., Krins, N., Hourlier-Fargette, A., Laberty-Robert, C., Neukirch, S., Antkowiak, A.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/296?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Soft deformable materials are needed for applications such as stretchable electronics, smart textiles, or soft biomedical devices.

Contraction of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) isolated from pulmonary arterial hypertensive (PAH) and normal (non-PAH) subject lungs was determined and measured with real-time electrical impedance. Treatment of HPASMC with vasoactive peptides, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and bradykinin (BK) but not angiotensin II, induced a temporal decrease in the electrical impedance profile mirroring constrictive morphological change of the cells which typically was more robust in PAH as opposed to non-PAH cells. Inhibition with LIMKi3 and a cofilin targeted motif mimicking cell permeable peptide (MMCPP) had no effect on ET-1 induced HPASMC contraction indicating a negligible role for these actin regulatory proteins. On the other hand, a MMCPP blocking the activity of caldesmon reduced ET-1 promoted contraction pointing to a regulatory role of this protein and its activation pathway in HPASMC contraction. Inhibition of this MEK/ERK/p90RSK pathway, which is an upstream regulator of caldesmon phosphorylation, reduced ET-1 induced cell contraction. While the regulation of ET-1 induced cell contraction was found to be similar in PAH and non-PAH cells, a key difference was the response to pharmacological inhibitors and to siRNA knockdown of Rho kinases (ROCK1/ROCK2). The PAH cells required much higher concentrations of inhibitors to abrogate ET-1 induced contractions and their contraction was not affected by siRNA against either ROCK1 or ROCK2. Lastly, blocking of L-type and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels had no effect on ET-1 or BK induced contraction. However, inhibiting the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase blunted ET-1 and BK induced HPASMC contraction in both PAH and non-PAH derived HPASMC. In summary, our findings here together with previous communications illustrate similarities and differences in the regulation PAH and non-PAH smooth muscle cell contraction relating to calcium translocation, RhoA/ROCK signaling and the activity of caldesmon. These findings may provide useful tools in achieving the regulation of the vascular hypercontractility taking place in PAH.</content></content><title>Unraveling endothelin-1 induced hypercontractility of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c7:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jamie L.

Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</content></content><title>Characterizing early embryonic development of Brown Tsaiya Ducks (&amp;lt;i&gt;Anas platyrhynchos&amp;lt;/i&gt;) in comparison with Taiwan Country Chicken (&amp;lt;i&gt;Gallus gallus domestics&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed8:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chompunut Lumsangkul, Yang-Kwang Fan, Shen-Chang Chang, Jyh-Cherng Ju, Hsin-I.

Macrophages are immune cells that compose the first line of an organism&apos;s defence against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the causative agent of TB. Interactions between macrophages and M.tb define the infection outcome. Enhancers are cis-regulatory DNA elements that activate transcription of target genes and mediate various responses in macrophages. To what extent the host&apos;s genetic response to infection is controlled by enhancers remains unexplored. We analysed the regulation by transcribed enhancers in M.tb-infected mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that transcribed enhancers have a strong influence in the M.tb infection response and mediate up-regulation of many important immune genes. We characterise highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and show that many genes acquire de novo transcribed enhancers upon M.tb infection. We report enhancers targeting known immune genes crucial for the host&apos;s genetic response to M.tb, such as Tnf, Tnfrsf1b, Irg1, Hilpda, Ccl3, and Ccl4, and highlight transcription factors that are likely regulating these enhancers including AP-1, NF-kB, Irf1, and Rbpj. Finally, we highlight particular chromosomal domains carrying groups of highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and genes with previously unappreciated roles in M.tb infection, such as Fbxl3, Tapt1, Edn1, and Hivep1. Our study links M.tb-responsive transcription factors to activation of transcribed enhancers, which, in turn, target protein-coding immune genes upon infection.

Macrophages are immune cells that compose the first line of an organism&apos;s defence against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the causative agent of TB. Interactions between macrophages and M.tb define the infection outcome. Enhancers are cis-regulatory DNA elements that activate transcription of target genes and mediate various responses in macrophages. To what extent the host&apos;s genetic response to infection is controlled by enhancers remains unexplored. We analysed the regulation by transcribed enhancers in M.tb-infected mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that transcribed enhancers have a strong influence in the M.tb infection response and mediate up-regulation of many important immune genes. We characterise highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and show that many genes acquire de novo transcribed enhancers upon M.tb infection. We report enhancers targeting known immune genes crucial for the host&apos;s genetic response to M.tb, such as Tnf, Tnfrsf1b, Irg1, Hilpda, Ccl3, and Ccl4, and highlight transcription factors that are likely regulating these enhancers including AP-1, NF-kB, Irf1, and Rbpj. Finally, we highlight particular chromosomal domains carrying groups of highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and genes with previously unappreciated roles in M.tb infection, such as Fbxl3, Tapt1, Edn1, and Hivep1. Our study links M.tb-responsive transcription factors to activation of transcribed enhancers, which, in turn, target protein-coding immune genes upon infection. We find that many genes who respond with increased expression to M.tb are under the control of transcribed enhancers. Our findings extend current knowledge of M.tb-response regulation in macrophages and provide a basis for future functional studies on enhancer-gene interactions in this process.</description><crawled>1524042617378</crawled><fingerprint>b31184a2</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/303552</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303552v1?rss=1</originId><published>1524034800000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303552v1?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Emerson H.

The increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus is becoming a serious threat to human health in various parts of the world. Studies with dairy products have shown a potential beneficial effect against diabetes. This experiment evaluated the supplementation of milk naturally enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and polyphenols in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Forty male 28-day-old &lt;i&gt;Wistar&lt;/i&gt; rats were distributed in four experimental treatments of diabetic animals (streptozotocin induction) and a normal group (non-induced). Experimental treatments were: control (water), whole common milk (COM-M), milk enriched with PUFA (PUFA-M), milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols (PUFA/P-M) through a special diet offered to dairy cows. Milk supplementation at a dose 5 mL/kg body weight was performed for 77 days, 42 days before and 35 days after diabetes induction. The COM-M supplementation increased brown fat deposits, reduced post-induction glucose levels, reduced blood fructosamine levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Milk enriched with PUFA reduced final fasting glucose, LDL levels, and improved blood antioxidant capacity. Milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols promoted an increase in gastrocnemius muscle mass, and a reduction in mesenteric fat and LDL levels. Milk intake, with an emphasis on milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols, attenuated the metabolic disorders of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.</content></content><title>Functionality of cow milk naturally enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols in diets for diabetic rats</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793631:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emerson H.

Thirteen variants (13/128, 10%) were ultimately classified as pathogenic. Most deaths (63%) occurred during sleep. Gene variant carriage was more likely with a positive medical history (mostly seizures, 63% vs 36%, p = 0.01), amongst females (36% vs 12%, p = 0.001) and whites more than Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Children 1–12 years were more likely to be gene-positive (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Family screening identified 42 gene-positive relatives, 18 with definitive phenotypic expression of LQTS/Brugada. 76% of the variants were maternally inherited (p = 0.007).

Objective &lt;p&gt;Different types of bone conduction transducers with different physical and electro-acoustic properties are available for audiometric hearing threshold measurements. The reference equivalent threshold vibratory force levels (RETVFL) specified in ISO 389–3 are based on measurements conducted with the B71 and KH70 transducers but apply to all types of transducers available for bone conduction audiometry. The objective of this study was to compare bone conduction hearing thresholds measured by different transducers.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;In a prospective study the hearing thresholds were measured psychometrically between 125 Hz and 8000 Hz using the Radioear B71, B81 and Präcitronic KH70 transducers.&lt;/p&gt; Study sample &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one normal hearing participants and fifteen hearing impaired participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In both groups significant differences were found between the thresholds measured with the different transducers at the low frequencies 125 Hz and 250 Hz and the high frequencies 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz and 8000 Hz. In the normal hearing group, deviations from the reference threshold 0 dB HL towards lower thresholds were observed for the B71 and B81 at 125 Hz and at the high frequencies 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz and 8000 Hz.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RETVFL-values should be reassessed and provided specifically for the different transducers.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Influence of transducer types on bone conduction hearing thresholds</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd86:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Fröhlich, Stefan K.

In the normal hearing group, deviations from the reference threshold 0 dB HL towards lower thresholds were observed for the B71 and B81 at 125 Hz and at the high frequencies 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz and 8000 Hz.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RETVFL-values should be reassessed and provided specifically for the different transducers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>5fbfd3fb</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195233</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195233</originId><published>1523480400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195233</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Di-Wei Zheng</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/I-fbcbUa-Z4/s41467-018-03233-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optically-controlled bacterial metabolite for cancer therapy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optically-controlled bacterial metabolite for cancer therapy, Published online: 26 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03233-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03233-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Targeting tumors with bacteria as vehicles for metabolite therapy suffers from low efficiency and robustness.

Contrary to the mainstream blood group systems, P1PK continues to puzzle and generate controversies over its molecular background. The P1PK system comprises three glycosphingolipid antigens: P&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, P1 and NOR, all synthesised by a glycosyltransferase called Gb3/CD77 synthase. The P&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; antigen is present in most individuals, whereas P1 frequency is lesser and varies regionally, thus underlying two common phenotypes: P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, if the P1 antigen is present, and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, when P1 is absent. Null and NOR phenotypes are extremely rare. To date, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been proposed to predict the P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; status, but it has not been clear how important they are in general and in relation to each other, nor has it been clear how synthesis of NOR affects the P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phenotype. Here, we quantitatively analysed the phenotypes and &lt;i&gt;A4GALT&lt;/i&gt; transcription in relation to the previously proposed SNPs in a sample of 109 individuals, and addressed potential P1 antigen level confounders, most notably the red cell membrane cholesterol content.

We previously introduced an approach for EVD prognosis prediction, using models that can be implemented in the field and updated in light of new data. Here we enhance and validate our methods with the largest published EVD dataset to date. We also present a proof-of-concept medical app that summarizes patient information and offers tailored treatment options using an interactive risk visualization for quick interpretation and decision-making. Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations. This tool may better inform treatment choices in future EVD outbreaks.

Here we enhance and validate our methods with the largest published EVD dataset to date. We also present a proof-of-concept medical app that summarizes patient information and offers tailored treatment options using an interactive risk visualization for quick interpretation and decision-making. Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations. This tool may better inform treatment choices in future EVD outbreaks. It also provides a template to validate additional datasets used in developing novel clinical-decision support systems for EVD and other emerging infectious diseases.</description><crawled>1523982712291</crawled><fingerprint>8b197a6a</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/17/294587</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587v2?rss=1</originId><published>1523948400000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/294587v2?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524171600000</updated><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196374</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Correction: Differential desulfurization of dibenzothiophene by newly identified MTCC strains: Influence of Operon Array</title><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196374</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f790d:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><fingerprint>3883712e</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196374</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196374</originId><published>1524171600000</published><visual><contentType>image/png</contentType><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196374.g001</url><width>320</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>169</height></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Shuo Feng</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023562?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Entropic elasticity based coarse-grained model of lipid membranes</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023562?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1630b2b1723:100d5ef:fc1f8953</id><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1524900763427</crawled><fingerprint>a1b62520</fingerprint><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023562?af=R</originId><published>1524807007000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Li, S.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/678?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><title>Pitch imperfect</title><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/678?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7fc:93d646dc</id><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>433e2877</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/678.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/678?rss=1</originId><published>1525974003000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot;

Background &lt;p&gt;We sought to develop a novel risk assessment tool to predict the clinical outcomes after heat-related illness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Prospective, multicenter observational study. Patients who transferred to emergency hospitals in Japan with heat-related illness were registered. The sample was divided into two parts: 60% to construct the score and 40% to validate it. A binary logistic regression model was used to predict hospital admission as a primary outcome. The resulting model was transformed into a scoring system.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,001 eligible patients were analyzed. There was no difference in variables between development and validation cohorts. Based on the result of a logistic regression model in the development phase (n = 1,805), the J-ERATO score was defined as the sum of the six binary components in the prehospital setting (respiratory rate≥22 /min, Glasgow coma scale&amp;lt;15, systolic blood pressure≤100 mmHg, heart rate≥100 bpm, body temperature≥38°C, and age≥65 y), for a total score ranging from 0 to 6. In the validation phase (n = 1,196), the score had excellent discrimination (C-statistic 0.84; 95% CI 0.79–0.89, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and calibration (P&gt;0.2 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The observed proportion of hospital admission increased with increasing J-ERATO score (score = 0, 5.0%; score = 1, 15.0%; score = 2, 24.6%; score = 3, 38.6%; score = 4, 68.0%; score = 5, 85.2%; score = 6, 96.4%). Multivariate analyses showed that the J-ERATO score was an independent positive predictor of hospital admission (adjusted OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.06–2.87; P&amp;lt;0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3.73; 2.95–4.72; P&amp;lt;0.001) and in-hospital mortality (1.65; 1.18–2.32; P = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The J-ERATO score is simply assessed and can facilitate the identification of patients with higher risk of heat-related hospitalization. This scoring system is also significantly associated with the higher likelihood of ICU admission and in-hospital mortality after heat-related hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>A novel early risk assessment tool for detecting clinical outcomes in patients with heat-related illness (J-ERATO score): Development and validation in independent cohorts in Japan</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bedb:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kei Hayashida, Yutaka Kondo, Toru Hifumi, Junya Shimazaki, Yasutaka Oda, Shinichiro Shiraishi, Tatsuma Fukuda, Junichi Sasaki, Keiki Shimizu&lt;/p&gt;

The reliable assessment and management of avian pain is important in the context of animal welfare. Overtly expressed signs of pain vary substantially between and within species, strains and individuals, limiting the use of behaviour in pain studies. Similarly, physiological indices of pain can also vary and may be confounded by influence from non-painful stimuli. In mammals, changes in the frequency spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded under light anaesthesia (the minimal anaesthesia model; MAM) have been shown to reliably indicate cerebral responses to noxious stimuli in a range of species. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the MAM can be applied to the study of nociception in birds. Ten chickens were lightly anaesthetised with halothane and their EEG recorded using surface electrodes during the application of supramaximal mechanical, thermal and electrical noxious stimuli. Spectral analysis revealed no EEG responses to any of these stimuli. Given that birds possess the neural apparatus to detect and process pain, and that the applied noxious stimuli elicit behavioural signs of pain in conscious chickens, this lack of response probably relates to methodological limitations. Anatomical differences between the avian and mammalian brains, along with a paucity of knowledge regarding specific sites of pain processing in the avian brain, could mean that EEG recorded from the head surface is insensitive to changes in neural activity in the pain processing regions of the avian brain. Future investigations should examine alternative electrode placement sites, based on avian homologues of the mammalian brain regions involved in pain processing.</content></content><title>Effects of noxious stimuli on the electroencephalogram of anaesthetised chickens (&amp;lt;i&gt;Gallus gallus domesticus&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae72:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amanda E.

Future investigations should examine alternative electrode placement sites, based on avian homologues of the mammalian brain regions involved in pain processing.</description><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><fingerprint>3eaa673c</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196454</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196454</originId><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196454</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Nicolas Unsain</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/RgN_s_mx4PA/s41598-018-23781-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Remodeling of the Actin/Spectrin Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton, Growth Cone Collapse and F-Actin Decrease during Axonal Degeneration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Remodeling of the Actin/Spectrin Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton, Growth Cone Collapse and F-Actin Decrease during Axonal Degeneration, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23781-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23781-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Remodeling of the Actin/Spectrin Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton, Growth Cone Collapse and F-Actin Decrease during Axonal Degeneration&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RgN_s_mx4PA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: Remodeling of the Actin/Spectrin Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton, Growth Cone Collapse and F-Actin Decrease during Axonal Degeneration</title><unread>True</unread><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b8bba806:bbff8f:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Remodeling of the Actin/Spectrin Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton, Growth Cone Collapse and F-Actin Decrease during Axonal Degeneration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Remodeling of the Actin/Spectrin Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton, Growth Cone Collapse and F-Actin Decrease during Axonal Degeneration, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23781-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23781-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Remodeling of the Actin/Spectrin Membrane-associated Periodic Skeleton, Growth Cone Collapse and F-Actin Decrease during Axonal Degeneration&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/RgN_s_mx4PA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523517728774</crawled><fingerprint>731fa5fc</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23781-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23781-w</originId><published>1523516400000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23781-w</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Haidai Hu, Akos Nemecz, Catherine Van Renterghem, Zaineb Fourati, Ludovic Sauguet, Pierre–Jean Corringer, Marc Delarue</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E3959.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) constitute a widespread class of ion channels, present in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes.

Systematics is considered important for effective toothbrushing. A theoretical concept of systematics in toothbrushing and a validated index to quantify it using observational data is suggested. The index consists of three components: completeness (all areas of the dentition reached), isochronicity (all areas brushed equally long) and consistency (avoiding frequent alternations between areas). Toothbrushing should take a sufficient length of time; therefore, this parameter is part of the index value calculation. Quantitative data from video observations were used including the number of changes between areas, number of areas reached, absolute brushing time and brushing time per area. These data were fed into two algorithms that converted the behaviour into two index values (each with values between 0 and 1) and were summed as the Toothbrushing Systematics Index (TSI) value; 0 indicates completely unsystematic and 2 indicates perfectly systematic brushing. The index was developed using theoretical data. The data matrices revealed the highest values when all areas are reached and brushed equally long. Few changes occurred between the areas when the brushing duration was ≥90 s; the lowest values occurred under opposite conditions. Clinical applicability was tested with data from re-analysed videos from an earlier intervention study aiming to establish a pre-defined toothbrushing sequence. Subjects who fully adopted this sequence had a baseline TSI of 1.30±0.26, which increased to 1.74±0.09 after the intervention (p≤0.001). When the participants who only partially adopted the sequence were included, the respective values were 1.25±0.27 and 1.69±0.14 (p≤0.001). The suggested new TS-index can cover a variety of clinically meaningful variations of systematic brushing, validly quantifies the changes in toothbrushing systematics and has discriminative power.</content></content><title>Toothbrushing Systematics Index (TSI) – A new tool for quantifying systematics in toothbrushing behaviour</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e4b:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadine Schlueter, Katrin Winterfeld, Vicenç Quera, Tobias Winterfeld, Carolina Ganss&lt;/p&gt;

From whole organisms to individual cells, responses to environmental conditions are influenced by genetic makeup, where the effect of genetic variation on a trait depends on the environmental context. RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic and environmental effects. In this study, we explore opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to discover &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting genotype-environment interactions (GxE)—genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12 unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10% FDR per trait) including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although using ASE is in principle a promising approach to detect GxE effects, replication of such signals can be challenging as validation requires harmonization of environmental traits across cohorts and a sufficient sampling of heterozygotes for a transcribed SNP. Comprehensive discovery and replication will require large human transcriptome datasets, or the integration of multiple transcribed SNPs, coupled with standardized clinical phenotyping.</content></content><title>Interactions between genetic variation and cellular environment in skeletal muscle gene expression</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae2:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by D.

TDP-43 is an ubiquitous and highly conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in several cellular processes including pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and transport. Notwithstanding the evidence of TDP-43 involvement in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. ALS and FTLD), the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Given the high degree of functional similarity between the human and fly orthologs of TDP-43, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; is a simple and useful model to study the pathophysiological role of this protein &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. It has been demonstrated that the depletion of the TDP-43 fly ortholog (tbph) induces deficient locomotive behaviors and reduces life span and anatomical defects at the neuromuscular junction. In this study, using the known binding specificity of TDP-43/tbph for (UG) repeated sequences, we performed a bioinformatic screening for fly genes with at least 6 (TG) repeats in a row within the 3&apos;-UTR regions in order to identify the genes that might be regulated by this factor. Among these genes, we were able to identify RhoGAPp190 as a potential target of the tbph-mediated neurodegeneration. RhoGAPp190 is a negative regulator of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; RhoA, a GTPase protein implicated in the fine modulation of critical cellular processes including axon branch stability and motor axon defasciculation at muscle level and cognitive processes. We were able to demonstrate that the RhoGAPp190 expression is upregulated in a tbph-null fly model, providing evidence that this deregulation is associated to tbph silencing. Our results introduce RhoGAPp190 as a novel potential mediator in the complex scenario of events resulting from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tbph loss-of-function.</content></content><title>RhoGAPp190: A potential player in tbph-mediated neurodegeneration in &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793632:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simona Langellotti, Giulia Romano, Fabian Feiguin, Francisco Ernesto Baralle, Maurizio Romano&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Pro-active case detection (Pro-ACD), in the form of voluntary screening and treatment (VSAT) following community mobilisation about ‘asymptomatic malaria’, is currently being evaluated as a tool for &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; elimination in Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted to explore community understanding, perceptions, expectations and acceptability of the Pro-ACD intervention in order to identify aspects that could be improved in future Pro-ACD activities. This was ancillary to a three-round VSAT campaign, carried out in three villages between December 2015 and March 2016. Qualitative data collection began shortly after the end of the three rounds of screening. Purposive sampling was used to select participants. Nine focus group discussions with participants (n = 46) and non-participants (n = 40) in the Pro-ACD screening were conducted, in addition to in-depth interviews with key village figures (n = 9).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Health promotion messages were well delivered and received, but it was difficult for many villagers to understand the messages around ‘asymptomatic malaria’. Overall, villagers and village leaders had a positive opinion about the VSAT intervention. Acceptability was high, as a direct consequence of favourable perceptions towards the screening activity: the Pro-ACD intervention was seen by the local population as an effective, inexpensive, reliable and readily available tool to protect individuals and the community from the insurgence of malaria. Physical absence and lack of time (both linked to work-related activities) were the main reasons for non-participation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although VSAT was generally well perceived and accepted, the ‘time factor’ related to the need to satisfy essential daily subsistence requirements played a significant role in determining participation in the screening. More well-adapted and meaningful Pro-ACD approaches could be implemented by improving the timing of the testing activites, and strengthening community participation and engagement to increase acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>‘I could not join because I had to work for pay.’: A qualitative evaluation of &amp;lt;i&gt;falciparum&amp;lt;/i&gt; malaria pro-active case detection in three rural Cambodian villages</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66cc:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pierluigi Taffon, Gabriele Rossi, Jean-Marie Kindermans, Rafael Van den Bergh, Chea Nguon, Mark Debackere, Lieven Vernaeve, Martin De Smet, Emilie Venables&lt;/p&gt;

A tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant mechanism is responsible for the electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions and relaxations of &lt;i&gt;Crotalus durissus terrificus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa. Here it was investigated whether this mechanism also occurs in corpora cavernosa and aortae of the non-venomous snake &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae. Corpora cavernosa and aortic rings isolated from &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; snake were mounted in organ bath system for isometric tension recording. EFS-induced contractions in both tissues were performed in the presence and absence of guanethidine (30 μM), phentolamine (10 μM) and tetrodotoxin (1 μM). In another set of experiments, the endothelium was removed from aortic rings and EFS-induced contractions were performed in the denuded rings. Electrical field stimulation-induced contractions were frequency-dependent in &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortic rings. The contractions were significantly reduced in the presence of guanethidine (30 μM) or phentolamine (10 μM). Pre-treatment with tetrodotoxin had no effect on the EFS-induced contractions of either corpora cavernosa or aortic rings. Surprisingly, the EFS-induced contractions of aortic rings denuded of endothelium were almost abolished. These results indicate that the TTX-resistant mechanism is present in EFS-induced contractions of &lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae. The experiments performed in the aorta indicate that the endothelium is the main source for the release of catecholamines induced by EFS.</content></content><title>Electrical field stimulation-induced contractions on &amp;lt;i&gt;Pantherophis guttatus&amp;lt;/i&gt; corpora cavernosa and aortae</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df0db9fe:45935cb:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Campos, Fabíola Z.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Studies of community-based obesity prevention interventions have hypothesized that stakeholder networks are a critical element of effective implementation. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the interpersonal network structures within a sub-sample of stakeholders from two past successful childhood obesity prevention interventions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants were recruited from the stakeholder groups (steering committees) of two completed community-based intervention studies, Romp &amp;amp; Chomp (R&amp;amp;C), Australia (2004-2008) and Shape Up Somerville (SUS), USA (2003-2005). Both studies demonstrated significant reductions of overweight and obesity among children. Members of the steering committees were asked to complete a retrospective social network questionnaire using a roster of other committee members and free recall. Each participant was asked to recall the people with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity throughout the intervention period, along with providing the closeness and level of influence of each relationship.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Networks were reported by 13 participants from the SUS steering committee and 8 participants from the R&amp;amp;C steering committee. On average, participants nominated 16 contacts with whom they discussed issues related to childhood obesity through the intervention, with approximately half of the relationships described as ‘close’ and 30% as ‘influential’. The ‘discussion’ and ‘close’ networks had high clustering and reciprocity, with ties directed to other steering committee members, and to individuals external to the committee.

We use computational tools to revert a recent crystal structure of an A3B construct to its native sequence, and run molecular dynamics simulations to study its underlying dynamics and substrate recognition mechanisms. The A3B-oligonucleotide substrate simulations show a series of dynamic substrate-protein contacts that correlate with previous work on A3B substrate selectivity.

We use computational tools to revert a recent crystal structure of an A3B construct to its native sequence, and run molecular dynamics simulations to study its underlying dynamics and substrate recognition mechanisms. The A3B-oligonucleotide substrate simulations show a series of dynamic substrate-protein contacts that correlate with previous work on A3B substrate selectivity. A second series of simulations in which the target cytosine nucleotide was computationally mutated from a deoxyribose to a ribose showed a change in sugar ring pucker, leading to a rearrangement of the binding site and revealing a potential intermediate in the binding pathway.

Here, we introduce Loter, an open-source software package that does not require any biological parameter besides haplotype data in order to make local ancestry inference available for a wide range of species. Using simulations, we compare the performance of Loter to HAPMIX, LAMP-LD, and RFMix. HAPMIX is the only software severely impacted by imperfect haplotype reconstruction. Loter is the less impacted software by increasing admixture time when considering simulated and admixed human genotypes. For simulations of admixed Populus genotypes, Loter and LAMP-LD are robust to increasing admixture times by contrast to RFMix. When comparing length of reconstructed and true ancestry tracts, Loter and LAMP-LD provide results whose accuracy is again more robust than RFMix to increasing admixture times. We apply Loter to individuals resulting from admixture between Populus trichocarpa and Populus balsamifera and lengths of ancestry tracts indicate that admixture took place around 100 generations ago. We expect that providing a rapid and parameter-free software for local ancestry inference will make more accessible genomic studies about admixture processes.</content></content><title>Loter: A software package to infer local ancestry for a wide range of species [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163038283a8:4a03fc:11c251fd</id><description>Admixture between populations provides opportunity to study biological adaptation and phenotypic variation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate in the Wistar rat the efficacy of various autologous nerve conduits with various forms of blood supply in reconstructing a 10-mm-long gap in the median nerve (MN) under conditions of local ischemia. A 10-mm-long median nerve defect was created in the right arm. A loose silicone tube was placed around the nerve gap zone, in order to simulate a local ischemic environment. Rats were divided in the following experimental groups (each with 20 rats): the nerve Graft (NG) group, in which the excised MN segment was reattached; the conventional nerve flap (CNF) and the arterialized neurovenous flap (ANVF) groups in which the gap was bridged with homonymous median nerve flaps; the prefabricated nerve flap (PNF) group in which the gap was reconstructed with a fabricated flap created by leaving an arteriovenous fistula in contact with the sciatic nerve for 5 weeks; and the two control groups, Sham and Excision groups. In the latter group, the proximal stump of the MN nerve was ligated and no repair was performed. The rats were followed for 100 days. During this time, they did physiotherapy. Functional, electroneuromyographic and histological studies were performed. The CNF and ANVF groups presented better results than the NG group in the following assessments: grasping test, nociception, motor stimulation threshold, muscle weight, and histomorphometric evaluation. Radial deviation of the operated forepaw was more common in rats that presented worse results in the other outcome variables. Overall, CNFs and ANVFs produced a faster and more complete recovery than NGs in the reconstruction of a 10-mm-long median nerve gap in an ischemic environment in the Wistar rat. Although, results obtained with CNFs were in most cases were better than ANVFs, these differences were not statistically significant for most of the outcome variables.</content></content><title>Reconstruction of a 10-mm-long median nerve gap in an ischemic environment using autologous conduits with different patterns of blood supply: A comparative study in the rat</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7adb:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diogo Casal, Eduarda Mota-Silva, Inês Iria, Sara Alves, Ana Farinho, Cláudia Pen, Nuno Lourenço-Silva, Luís Mascarenhas-Lemos, José Silva-Ferreira, Mário Ferraz-Oliveira, Valentina Vassilenko, Paula Alexandra Videira, João Goyri-O’Neill, Diogo Pais&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamin Guanosine Triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases) are best studied for their role in the terminal membrane fission process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), but they have also been proposed to regulate earlier stages of CME. Although highly enriched in neurons, dynamin-1 (Dyn1) is, in fact, widely expressed along with Dyn2 but inactivated in non-neuronal cells via phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) kinase. Here, we study the differential, isoform-specific functions of Dyn1 and Dyn2 as regulators of CME. Endogenously expressed Dyn1 and Dyn2 were fluorescently tagged either separately or together in two cell lines with contrasting Dyn1 expression levels. By quantitative live cell dual- and triple-channel total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we find that Dyn2 is more efficiently recruited to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) than Dyn1, and that Dyn2 but not Dyn1 exhibits a pronounced burst of assembly, presumably into supramolecular collar-like structures that drive membrane scission and clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation. Activation of Dyn1 by acute inhibition of GSK3β results in more rapid endocytosis of transferrin receptors, increased rates of CCP initiation, and decreased CCP lifetimes but did not significantly affect the extent of Dyn1 recruitment to CCPs. Thus, activated Dyn1 can regulate early stages of CME that occur well upstream of fission, even when present at low, substoichiometric levels relative to Dyn2. Under physiological conditions, Dyn1 is activated downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to alter CCP dynamics. We identify sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) as a preferred binding partner to activated Dyn1 that is partially required for Dyn1-dependent effects on early stages of CCP maturation. Together, we decouple regulatory and scission functions of dynamins and report a scission-independent, isoform-specific regulatory role for Dyn1 in CME.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k6hPvNlNbzg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>A noncanonical role for dynamin-1 in regulating early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in non-neuronal cells</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162d9ef60bd:bb316e:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Saipraveen Srinivasan, Christoph J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Next generation sequencing tests (NGS) are usually performed on relatively small core biopsy or fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples. Data is limited on what amount of tumor by volume or minimum number of FNA passes are needed to yield sufficient material for running NGS. We sought to identify the amount of tumor for running the PCDx NGS platform.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;2,723 consecutive tumor tissues of all cancer types were queried and reviewed for inclusion. Information on tumor volume, success of performing NGS, and results of NGS were compiled. Assessment of sequence analysis, mutation calling and sensitivity, quality control, drug associations, and data aggregation and analysis were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;6.4% of samples were rejected from all testing due to insufficient tumor quantity. The number of genes with insufficient sensitivity make definitive mutation calls increased as the percentage of tumor decreased, reaching statistical significance below 5% tumor content. The number of drug associations also decreased with a lower percentage of tumor, but this difference only became significant between 1–3%.

Background &lt;p&gt;Next generation sequencing tests (NGS) are usually performed on relatively small core biopsy or fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples. Data is limited on what amount of tumor by volume or minimum number of FNA passes are needed to yield sufficient material for running NGS. We sought to identify the amount of tumor for running the PCDx NGS platform.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;2,723 consecutive tumor tissues of all cancer types were queried and reviewed for inclusion. Information on tumor volume, success of performing NGS, and results of NGS were compiled. Assessment of sequence analysis, mutation calling and sensitivity, quality control, drug associations, and data aggregation and analysis were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;6.4% of samples were rejected from all testing due to insufficient tumor quantity. The number of genes with insufficient sensitivity make definitive mutation calls increased as the percentage of tumor decreased, reaching statistical significance below 5% tumor content. The number of drug associations also decreased with a lower percentage of tumor, but this difference only became significant between 1–3%. The number of drug associations did decrease with smaller tissue size as expected. Neither specimen size or percentage of tumor affected the ability to pass mRNA quality control. A tumor area of 10 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; provides a good margin of error for specimens to yield adequate drug association results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Specimen suitability remains a major obstacle to clinical NGS testing. We determined that PCR-based library creation methods allow the use of smaller specimens, and those with a lower percentage of tumor cells to be run on the PCDx NGS platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><fingerprint>a93924ff</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196556</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196556</originId><published>1524862800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196556</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1525899600000</updated><author><name>Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196866</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;
The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</content></content><title>Visual perceptual training reconfigures post-task resting-state functional connectivity with a feature-representation region</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed5:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Stereotactic radiotherapy, which delivers an ablative high radiation dose to a target volume for maximum local tumor control, requires a rapid dose fall-off outside the target volume to prevent extensive damage to nearby normal tissue. Currently, there is no tool to comprehensively evaluate the dose gradient near the target volume. We propose the dose gradient curve (DGC) as a new tool to evaluate the quality of a treatment plan with respect to the dose fall-off characteristics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The average distance between two isodose surfaces was represented by the dose gradient index (DGI) estimated by a simple equation using the volume and surface area of isodose levels. The surface area was calculated by mesh generation and surface triangulation. The DGC was defined as a plot of the DGI of each dose interval as a function of the dose. Two types of DGCs, &lt;i&gt;differential&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cumulative&lt;/i&gt;, were generated. The performance of the DGC was evaluated using stereotactic radiosurgery plans for virtual targets.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Over the range of dose distributions, the dose gradient of each dose interval was well-characterized by the DGC in an easily understandable graph format. Significant changes in the DGC were observed reflecting the differences in planning situations and various prescription doses.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The DGC is a rational method for visualizing the dose gradient as the average distance between two isodose surfaces; the shorter the distance, the steeper the dose gradient. By combining the DGC with the dose-volume histogram (DVH) in a single plot, the DGC can be utilized to evaluate not only the dose gradient but also the target coverage in routine clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Dose gradient curve: A new tool for evaluating dose gradient</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefc2:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by KiHoon Sung, Young Eun Choi&lt;/p&gt;

The beneficial effects of physical activity for the prevention and management of several chronic diseases are widely recognized. Mathematical modeling of the effects of physical exercise in body metabolism and in particular its influence on the control of glucose homeostasis is of primary importance in the development of eHealth monitoring devices for a personalized medicine. Nonetheless, to date only a few mathematical models have been aiming at this specific purpose. We have developed a whole-body computational model of the effects on metabolic homeostasis of a bout of physical exercise. Built upon an existing model, it allows to detail better both subjects’ characteristics and physical exercise, thus determining to a greater extent the dynamics of the hormones and the metabolites considered.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L9MBzxj-2FY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Personalizing physical exercise in a computational model of fuel homeostasis</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163030ef984:a5a3c6:c2c34441</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Concetta Palumbo, Micaela Morettini, Paolo Tieri, Fasma Diele, Massimo Sacchetti, Filippo Castiglione&lt;/p&gt;

Pearl millet is a cereal crop known for its high tolerance to drought, heat and salinity stresses as well as for its nutritional quality. The molecular mechanism of drought tolerance in pearl millet is unknown. Here we attempted to unravel the molecular basis of drought tolerance in two pearl millet inbred lines, ICMB 843 and ICMB 863 using RNA sequencing. Under greenhouse condition, ICMB 843 was found to be more tolerant to drought than ICMB 863. We sequenced the root transcriptome from both lines under control and drought conditions using an Illumina Hi-Seq platform, generating 139.1 million reads. Mapping of sequenced reads against the foxtail millet genome, which has been relatively well-annotated, led to the identification of several differentially expressed genes under drought stress. Total of 6799 and 1253 differentially expressed genes were found in ICMB 843 and ICMB 863, respectively. Pathway and gene function analysis by KEGG online tool revealed that the drought response in pearl millet is mainly regulated by pathways related to photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. The changes in expression of drought-responsive genes determined by RNA sequencing were confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR for 7 genes. These results are a first step to understanding the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in pearl millet and lay a foundation for its genetic improvement.</content></content><title>Transcriptomic analysis reveals the differentially expressed genes and pathways involved in drought tolerance in pearl millet [&amp;lt;i&gt;Pennisetum glaucum&amp;lt;/i&gt; (L.)

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To develop a simple dementia screening tool to assist primary care physicians in identifying patients with cognitive impairment among subjects with memory complaints or at a high risk for dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The Brain Health Test (BHT) was developed by several experienced neurologists, psychiatrists, and clinical psychologists in the Taiwan Dementia Society. Validation of the BHT was conducted in the memory clinics of various levels of hospitals in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Participants &lt;p&gt;All dementia patients at the memory clinics who met the inclusion criteria of age greater or equal to 50 years were enrolled. Besides the BHT, the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating were used to evaluate the cognition state of the patients and the severity of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The BHT includes two parts: a risk evaluation and a cognitive test (BHT-cog). Self or informants reports of memory decline or needing help from others to manage money or medications were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Among the risk factors evaluated in the BHT, a total risk score greater or equal to 8 was defined as a high risk for dementia. The total score for the finalized BHT-cog was 16. When the cutoff value for the BHT-cog was set to 10 for differentiating dementia and a normal mental state, the sensitivity was 91.5%, the specificity was 87.3%, the positive predictive value was 94.8%, and the negative predictive value was 80.1% The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between dementia and healthy subjects was 0.958 (95% CI = 0.941–0.975).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The BHT is a simple tool that may be useful in primary care settings to identify high-risk patients to target for cognitive screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Development and validation of a dementia screening tool for primary care in Taiwan: Brain Health Test</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b9:91749e5b</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ping-Huang Tsai, Jian-Liang Liu, Ker-Neng Lin, Chiung-Chih Chang, Ming-Chyi Pai, Wen-Fu Wang, Jen-Ping Huang, Tzung-Jeng Hwang, Pei-Ning Wang&lt;/p&gt;

There is a quest for production of soluble protein of high quality for the study of T-cell receptors (TCRs), but expression often results in low yields of functional molecules. In this study, we used an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; chaperone-assisted periplasmic production system and compared expression of 4 different soluble TCR formats: single-chain TCR (scTCR), two different disulfide-linked TCR (dsTCR) formats, and chimeric Fab (cFab). A stabilized version of scTCR was also included. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of host (XL1-Blue or RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) and the effect of IPTG induction on expression profiles. A celiac disease patient-derived TCR with specificity for gluten was used, and we achieved detectable expression for all formats and variants. We found that expression in RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; without IPTG induction resulted in the highest periplasmic yields. Moreover, after large-scale expression and protein purification, only the scTCR format was obtained in high yields. Importantly, stability engineering of the scTCR was a prerequisite for obtaining reliable biophysical characterization of the TCR-pMHC interaction. The scTCR format is readily compatible with high-throughput screening approaches that may enable both development of reagents allowing for defined peptide MHC (pMHC) characterization and discovery of potential novel therapeutic leads.</content></content><title>Soluble T-cell receptor design influences functional yield in an &amp;lt;i&gt;E&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; chaperone-assisted expression system</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d4:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kristin Støen Gunnarsen, Lene Støkken Høydahl, Ralf Stefan Neumann, Kaare Bjerregaard-Andersen, Nicolay Rustad Nilssen, Ludvig Magne Sollid, Inger Sandlie, Geir Åge Løset&lt;/p&gt;

The processes regulating peripheral naive T-cell numbers and clonal diversity remain poorly understood. Conceptually, homeostatic mechanisms must fall into the broad categories of neutral (simple random birth–death models), competition (regulation of cell numbers through quorum-sensing, perhaps via limiting shared resources), adaptation (involving cell-intrinsic changes in homeostatic fitness, defined as net growth rate over time), or selection (involving the loss or outgrowth of cell populations deriving from intercellular variation in fitness). There may also be stably maintained heterogeneity within the naive T-cell pool. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we confront very general models of these processes with an array of experimental data, both new and published. While reduced competition for homeostatic stimuli may impact cell survival or proliferation in neonates or under moderate to severe lymphopenia, we show that the only mechanism capable of explaining multiple, independent experimental studies of naive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell homeostasis in mice from young adulthood into old age is one of adaptation, in which cells act independently and accrue a survival or proliferative advantage continuously with their post-thymic age. However, aged naive T cells may also be functionally impaired, and so the accumulation of older cells via ‘conditioning through experience’ may contribute to reduced immune responsiveness in the elderly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_sQDfPObu6Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Age is not just a number: Naive T cells increase their ability to persist in the circulation over time</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162b5d1647d:50b536:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanket Rane, Thea Hogan, Benedict Seddon, Andrew J.

We investigated how visual and kinaesthetic/efferent information is integrated for speed perception in running. Twelve moderately trained to trained subjects ran on a treadmill at three different speeds (8, 10, 12 km/h) in front of a moving virtual scene. They were asked to match the visual speed of the scene to their running speed–i.e., treadmill’s speed. For each trial, participants indicated whether the scene was moving slower or faster than they were running. Visual speed was adjusted according to their response using a staircase until the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) was reached, i.e., until visual and running speed were perceived as equivalent. For all three running speeds, participants systematically underestimated the visual speed relative to their actual running speed. Indeed, the speed of the visual scene had to exceed the actual running speed in order to be perceived as equivalent to the treadmill speed. The underestimation of visual speed was speed-dependent, and percentage of underestimation relative to running speed ranged from 15% at 8km/h to 31% at 12km/h. We suggest that this fact should be taken into consideration to improve the design of attractive treadmill-mediated virtual environments enhancing engagement into physical activity for healthier lifestyles and disease prevention and care.</content></content><title>Matching optical flow to motor speed in virtual reality while running on a treadmill</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d5:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Caramenti, Claudio L.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of active weight loss attempts in Sweden, and to study the extent to which overweight individuals may or may not correctly identify themselves as overweight. Additional aims were to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with following a specific dietary regimen and with attempts at losing weight. A postal questionnaire was sent to 2000 randomly selected men and women living in Sweden. The inclusion criteria was an age of 20–65 years. In total, the response rate was 28% and the completed questionnaires from 555 participants were analyzed in this study. In total, 46% of participants were overweight or obese by self-reported height and weight. Additionally, 42% of overweight and 90% of obese individuals correctly identified themselves as being overweight. Weight loss was pursued by 41% and was more common among women, those with higher physical activity, higher BMI and higher socioeconomic position. Overall, 22% followed a specific diet, and following a dietary regimen was associated with female gender, higher education level and overweight. In conclusion, almost half of the participants were either overweight or trying to lose weight. Trying to lose weight and following a specific dietary regimen were related to female gender, high BMI and higher socioeconomic position. This could indicate that the socioeconomic disparities in health are further exacerbated, as overweight individuals with poor socioeconomic position might be more likely to remain overweight.</content></content><title>Sociodemographic factors associated with reported attempts at weight loss and specific dietary regimens in Sweden: The SWEDIET-2017 study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914e:93d646dc</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linnea Bärebring, Anna Winkvist, Hanna Augustin&lt;/p&gt;

Characterisation and thermal deterioration of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk is presented for the first time using the potential of Fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission bands in non-heated desi ghee centred at 375 nm is labelled for vitamin D, 390 nm for vitamin K, 440–460 nm for isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), 490 nm for vitamin A and the region 620–700 nm is assigned to chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission spectra from all the heated and non-heated ghee samples were recorded using excitation wavelengths at 280, and 410 nm which were found best for getting maximum spectral signatures. Heating of desi ghee affects its molecular composition, however, the temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be defined safe for cooking /frying where it does not lose much of its molecular composition. Further, the rise in temperature induces prominent spectral variations which confirm the deterioration of valuable vitamins, isomers of CLA and chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission peak at 552 nm shows oxidation product and an increase in its intensity with the rise in temperature is observed. In order to classify heated samples at different temperatures, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on heated and non-heated ghee samples that further elucidated the temperature effects.</content></content><title>Studying heating effects on desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk using fluorescence spectroscopy</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f80:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naveed Ahmad, M.

Fluorescence emission spectra from all the heated and non-heated ghee samples were recorded using excitation wavelengths at 280, and 410 nm which were found best for getting maximum spectral signatures. Heating of desi ghee affects its molecular composition, however, the temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be defined safe for cooking /frying where it does not lose much of its molecular composition. Further, the rise in temperature induces prominent spectral variations which confirm the deterioration of valuable vitamins, isomers of CLA and chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission peak at 552 nm shows oxidation product and an increase in its intensity with the rise in temperature is observed. In order to classify heated samples at different temperatures, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on heated and non-heated ghee samples that further elucidated the temperature effects.</description><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><fingerprint>74e1d818</fingerprint><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197340</originId><published>1526072400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197340</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>60</engagement><author><name>Holly Else</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04958-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Young researchers who narrowly miss out on postdoctoral grant struggle to compete with those who just qualify.</content></content><title>Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162f3be485c:62505c7:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists’ early grant success fuels further funding, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04958-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Young researchers who narrowly miss out on postdoctoral grant struggle to compete with those who just qualify.</description><crawled>1524507756636</crawled><fingerprint>72e720de</fingerprint><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04958-9</originId><published>1524466800000</published><recrawled>1524513320971</recrawled><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04958-9/d41586-018-04958-9_15713116.jpg</url><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><height>576</height></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and Reptation

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), is a transcription factor that governs pathways, such as lipid metabolism and immune response, that have been implicated in the etiology of LOAD. Previously, we established HepG2-derived cell-lines with stable knockdown of PPARγ gene, and showed an increase in mRNA levels of genes mapped in the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; linkage disequilibrium (LD) region on chromosome 19q13.32, with the greatest effect observed for &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-mRNA. Here, we extended the analysis using our &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown model system and investigated the broader effect on expression changes of genes implicated in LOAD via genome wide association studies (GWAS). We applied the nCounter gene expression assay (NanoString) using a panel of twenty-four LOAD-associated genes inferred by proximity to the top significantly associated SNPs. Two independent &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown cell-lines showed changes in mRNA levels of a total of seven genes compared to a control HepG2 cell-line; six of which, &lt;i&gt;ABCA7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CASS4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CELF1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PTK2B&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ZCWPW1&lt;/i&gt;, were upregulated and one, &lt;i&gt;DSG2&lt;/i&gt;, was downregulated upon &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. Our results propose that &lt;i&gt;PPARγ&lt;/i&gt; may act as a master regulator of the transcription of several genes involved in LOAD pathogenesis. Our study provided the premise for further analyses including a larger set of genes positioned within a wider range of linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions tagged by all LOAD significantly associated SNPs.</content></content><title>Probing the role of PPARγ in the regulation of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease-associated genes</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af2:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julio Barrera, Shobana Subramanian, Ornit Chiba-Falek&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Placental dysfunction is related to many pregnancy complications, but collecting placental specimens for investigation in large scale epidemiologic studies is often infeasible.

We aimed to collect pilot data regarding the feasibility and precision of a simpler approach, the collection of tissue samples following 24 hours of refrigeration of whole placentae at 4°C, as compared to the “gold standard” of snap freezing excised tissue within 40 minutes of delivery for the assessment of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Placentae were collected from 12 women after delivering live-born singleton babies via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Two placentae were utilized to establish laboratory tissue processing and assay protocols. The other 10 placentae were utilized in a comparison of three tissue collection conditions.

The co-existence of several ploidy types in natural populations makes the cyprinid loach &lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; an exciting model system to study the genetic and phenotypic consequences of ploidy variations. A first step in such effort is to identify the specific ploidy of an individual. Currently popular methods of karyotyping via cytological preparation or flow cytometry require a large amount of tissue (such as blood) samples, which can be damaging or fatal to the fishes. Here, we developed novel microsatellite markers (SSR markers) from &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; and show that they can effectively discriminate ploidy using samples collected in a minimally invasive way. Specifically, we generated whole genome transcriptomes from multiple &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; using the Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 150 million raw reads were assembled into 76,544 non-redundant unigenes. A total of 8,194 potential SSR markers were identified. We selected 98 pairs with more than five tandem repeats for further assays. Out of 45 putative EST-SSR markers that successfully amplified and harbored polymorphism in diploids, 11 markers displayed high variability in tetraploids.

The co-existence of several ploidy types in natural populations makes the cyprinid loach &lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; an exciting model system to study the genetic and phenotypic consequences of ploidy variations. A first step in such effort is to identify the specific ploidy of an individual. Currently popular methods of karyotyping via cytological preparation or flow cytometry require a large amount of tissue (such as blood) samples, which can be damaging or fatal to the fishes. Here, we developed novel microsatellite markers (SSR markers) from &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; and show that they can effectively discriminate ploidy using samples collected in a minimally invasive way. Specifically, we generated whole genome transcriptomes from multiple &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt; using the Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 150 million raw reads were assembled into 76,544 non-redundant unigenes. A total of 8,194 potential SSR markers were identified. We selected 98 pairs with more than five tandem repeats for further assays. Out of 45 putative EST-SSR markers that successfully amplified and harbored polymorphism in diploids, 11 markers displayed high variability in tetraploids. We further demonstrate that a set of five EST-SSR markers selected from these are sufficient to distinguish ploidy levels, by first validating them on 69 reference specimens with known ploidy levels and then subsequently using fresh-collected 96 ploidy-unknown specimens. The results from EST-SSR markers are highly concordant with those from independent flow cytometry analysis. The novel EST-SSR markers developed here should facilitate genetic studies of polyploidy in the emerging model system &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt;.</description><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>98eba322</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195829</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195829</originId><published>1523566800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195829</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00176/20180501/images/medium/bi-2018-00176r_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00176&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

As babette is designed to be of high quality and extendable, we conclude by describing the further development of the package.</description><crawled>1525714993792</crawled><fingerprint>5cf5a43d</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/07/271866</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271866v5?rss=1</originId><published>1525676400000</published><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271866v5?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Yasser Fuentes-Edfuf</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/QpLMvzr3_As/s41598-018-24091-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Coherent scatter-controlled phase-change grating structures in silicon using femtosecond laser pulses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Coherent scatter-controlled phase-change grating structures in silicon using femtosecond laser pulses, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24091-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24091-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Coherent scatter-controlled phase-change grating structures in silicon using femtosecond laser pulses&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/QpLMvzr3_As&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: Coherent scatter-controlled phase-change grating structures in silicon using femtosecond laser pulses</title><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24091-x</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b6cb9e2b:918ca5:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Coherent scatter-controlled phase-change grating structures in silicon using femtosecond laser pulses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Coherent scatter-controlled phase-change grating structures in silicon using femtosecond laser pulses, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24091-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24091-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Coherent scatter-controlled phase-change grating structures in silicon using femtosecond laser pulses&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/QpLMvzr3_As&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523485220395</crawled><fingerprint>6d1474e0</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24091-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24091-x</originId><published>1523516400000</published><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1525726800000</updated><author><name>Antonina Germano</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196931</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antonina Germano, Laura Saba, Silvia De Francia, Ida Rapa, Paola Perotti, Alfredo Berruti, Marco Volante, Massimo Terzolo&lt;/p&gt;
Mitotane is the reference drug for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and the metabolic activation of the drug is considered as essential for its activity. The aim of this study was to assess the role of CYP11B1 on mitotane action and metabolism in H295R ACC cells to understand whether this enzyme may influence mitotane action. The simultaneous incubation with mitotane and metyrapone, an adrenolytic molecule targeting 11-beta-hydroxylase, did not influence mitotane-mediated cytotoxic effect and metabolism in H295R ACC cells. CYP11B1 silencing confirmed the lack of a significant metyrapone effect on mitotane action. The present findings do not support the view that CYP11B1 catalyzes a crucial step in the metabolic activation of mitotane and that CYP11B1 confers the adrenal specificity to mitotane.</content></content><title>CYP11B1 has no role in mitotane action and metabolism in adrenocortical carcinoma cells</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4225e:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonina Germano, Laura Saba, Silvia De Francia, Ida Rapa, Paola Perotti, Alfredo Berruti, Marco Volante, Massimo Terzolo&lt;/p&gt;

Cities around the world are inundated by cars and suffer traffic congestion that results in excess delays, reduced safety and environmental pollution. The interplay between road infrastructure and travel choices defines the level and the spatio-temporal extent of congestion. Given the existing infrastructure, understanding how the route choice decisions are made and how travellers interact with each other is a crucial first step in mitigating traffic congestion. This is a problem with fundamental importance, as it has implications for other limited supply systems where agents compete for resources and reach an equilibrium. Here, we observe the route choice decisions and the traffic conditions through an extensive data set of GPS trajectories. We compare the actual paths followed by travellers to those implied by equilibrium conditions (i) at a microscopic scale, where we focus on individual path similarities, and (ii) at a macroscopic scale, where we perform network-level comparison of the traffic loads. We present that non-cooperative or selfish equilibrium replicates the actual traffic (to a certain extent) at the macroscopic scale, while the majority of individual decisions cannot be reproduced by neither selfish nor cooperative equilibrium models.</content></content><title>Searching for empirical evidence on traffic equilibrium</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42265:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehmet Yildirimoglu, Osman Kahraman&lt;/p&gt;

Some epidemiological studies indicate that the use of mobile phones causes cancer in humans (in particular glioblastomas). It is known that DNA damage plays a key role in malignant transformation; therefore, we investigated the impact of the UMTS signal which is widely used in mobile telecommunications, on DNA stability in ten different human cell lines (six brain derived cell lines, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, liver and buccal tissue derived cells) under conditions relevant for users (SAR 0.25 to 1.00 W/kg). We found no evidence for induction of damage in single cell gel electrophoresis assays when the cells were cultivated with serum. However, clear positive effects were seen in a p53 proficient glioblastoma line (U87) when the cells were grown under serum free conditions, while no effects were found in p53 deficient glioblastoma cells (U251). Further experiments showed that the damage disappears rapidly in U87 and that exposure induced nucleotide excision repair (NER) and does not cause double strand breaks (DSBs). The observation of NER induction is supported by results of a proteome analysis indicating that several proteins involved in NER are up-regulated after exposure to UMTS; additionally, we found limited evidence for the activation of the γ-interferon pathway. The present findings show that the signal causes transient genetic instability in glioma derived cells and activates cellular defense systems.</content></content><title>Mobile phone specific electromagnetic fields induce transient DNA damage and nucleotide excision repair in serum-deprived human glioblastoma cells</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7123:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Halh Al-Serori, Franziska Ferk, Michael Kundi, Andrea Bileck, Christopher Gerner, Miroslav Mišík, Armen Nersesyan, Monika Waldherr, Manuel Murbach, Tamara T.

Methods and results &lt;p&gt;Treatment of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) with β-AR agonist (isoproterenol) for 15 min increased phosphorylation (serine-518) and sumoylation of NF2. Co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed β-AR-stimulated sumoylation of NF2. β-AR stimulation enhanced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated and sumoylated NF2.

Methods and results &lt;p&gt;Treatment of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) with β-AR agonist (isoproterenol) for 15 min increased phosphorylation (serine-518) and sumoylation of NF2. Co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed β-AR-stimulated sumoylation of NF2. β-AR stimulation enhanced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated and sumoylated NF2.

High-risk injection related behavior including use of non-sterile syringes is associated with negative health outcomes among people who inject drugs (PWID). Drug treatment programs have been reported to curb hepatitis C (HCV) transmission. This study aims to assess the role of drug treatment programs and knowledge of HCV status, and how they influence current injection-related risk. Data were collected in 2012 by the New Orleans arm of the CDC funded National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit a sample of PWID. The analytic sample consisted of 473 participants. Univariate, bivariate, and linear regression analyses were performed. Findings indicated that history of drug treatment is associated with sterile syringe use among PWID. Further, knowledge of HCV status modifies the relationship between history of drug treatment and sterile syringe use in this sample. These findings highlight the importance of scaling up prevention efforts by expanding testing, counselling, and treatment for HCV among PWID who enter drug treatment facilities.</content></content><title>Knowledge of hepatitis C status moderates the relationship between history of drug treatment and sterile syringe use</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d73e:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kiva Ariani Fisher, Laura Michele Cahill, Stephanie Broyles, Marion Rorke, William Thomas Robinson&lt;/p&gt;

E487K point mutation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 2 (ALDH2*2) in East Asians intrinsically lowers ALDH2 activity. ALDH2*2 is associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diabetic patients exhibit heart failure of preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) i.e. while the systolic heart function is preserved in them, they may exhibit diastolic dysfunction, implying a jeopardized myocardial health. Currently, it is challenging to detect cardiac functional deterioration in diabetic mice. Stress echocardiography (echo) in the clinical set-up is a procedure used to measure cardiac reserve and impaired cardiac function in coronary artery diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that high-fat diet fed type-2 diabetic ALDH2*2 mutant mice exhibit HFpEF which can be measured by cardiac echo stress test methodology. We induced type-2 diabetes in 12-week-old male C57BL/6 and ALDH2*2 mice through a high-fat diet. At the end of 4 months of DM induction, we measured the cardiac function in diabetic and control mice of C57BL/6 and ALDH2*2 genotypes by conscious echo. Subsequently, we imposed exercise stress by allowing the mice to run on the treadmill until exhaustion. Post-stress, we measured their cardiac function again. Only after treadmill running, but not at rest, we found a significant decrease in % fractional shortening and % ejection fraction in ALDH2*2 mice with diabetes compared to C57BL/6 diabetic mice as well as non-diabetic (control) ALDH2*2 mice. The diabetic ALDH2*2 mice also exhibited poor maximal running speed and distance. Our data suggest that high-fat fed diabetic ALDH2*2 mice exhibit HFpEF and treadmill exercise stress echo test is able to determine this HFpEF in the diabetic ALDH2*2 mice.</content></content><title>Type-2 diabetic aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 mutant mice (ALDH 2*2) exhibiting heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype can be determined by exercise stress echocardiography</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f9:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guodong Pan, Srikar Munukutla, Ananya Kar, Joseph Gardinier, Rajarajan A.

The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels.

The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot;

Often &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; are harmless and/or beneficial bacteria inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of livestock and humans. However, Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) have been linked to human disease. Cattle are the primary reservoir for STEC and STEC “super-shedders” are considered to be a major contributor in animal to animal transmission. Among STEC, O157:H7 is the most recognized serotype, but in recent years, non-O157 STEC have been increasingly linked to human disease. In Argentina and Germany, O178 is considered an emerging pathogen. Our objective was to compare populations of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178, O157, shiga toxin 1 and 2 in western Canadian cattle feces from a sampling pool of ~80,000 beef cattle collected at two slaughterhouses. Conventional PCR was utilized to screen 1,773 samples for presence/absence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178. A subset of samples (n = 168) was enumerated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and proportions of O178, O157 and shiga toxins 1 &amp;amp; 2 specific-fragments were calculated as a proportion of generic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (GEC) specific-fragments. Distribution of &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by comparing &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O157 enumerations. Conventional PCR detected the presence of O178 in 873 of 1,773 samples and ddPCR found the average proportion of O178, O157, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the samples 2.8%, 0.6%, 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively.

Our results confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178 in western Canadian cattle and ddPCR revealed O178 as a greater proportion of GEC than was O157.

Sexual transmission is the principal driver of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. Understanding HIV vaccine-induced immune responses at mucosal surfaces can generate hypotheses regarding mechanisms of protection, and may influence vaccine development. The RV144 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00223080) efficacy trial showed protection against HIV infections but mucosal samples were not collected, therefore, the contribution of mucosal antibodies to preventing HIV-1 acquisition is unknown. Here, we report the generation, magnitude and persistence of antibody responses to recombinant gp120 envelope and antigens including variable one and two loop scaffold antigens (gp70V1V2) previously shown to correlate with risk in RV144. We evaluated antibody responses to gp120 A244gD and gp70V1V2 92TH023 (both CRF01_AE) and Case A2 (subtype B) in cervico-vaginal mucus (CVM), seminal plasma (SP) and rectal secretions (RS) from HIV-uninfected RV144 vaccine recipients, who were randomized to receive two late boosts of ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E, AIDSVAX®B/E, or ALVAC-HIV alone at 0 and 6 months. Late vaccine boosting increased IgG geometric mean titers (GMT) to gp120 A244gD in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (28 and 17 fold, respectively), followed by SP and RS. IgG to gp70V1V2 92TH023 increased in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM (11–17 fold) and SP (2 fold) two weeks post first boost. IgG to Case A2 was only detected in AIDSVAX®B/E and ALVAC-HIV/AIDSVAX®B/E CVM. Mucosal IgG to gp120 A244gD (CVM, SP, RS), gp70V1V2 92TH023 (CVM, SP), and Case A2 (CVM) correlated with plasma IgG levels (p&amp;lt;0.001). Although the magnitude of IgG responses declined after boosting, anti-gp120 A244gD IgG responses in CVM persisted for 12 months post final vaccination. Further studies in localization, persistence and magnitude of envelope specific antibodies (IgG and dimeric IgA) in anogenital secretions will help determine their role in preventing mucosal HIV acquisition.</content></content><title>Characterization of HIV-1 gp120 antibody specificities induced in anogenital secretions of RV144 vaccine recipients after late boost immunizations</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d748:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siriwat Akapirat, Chitraporn Karnasuta, Sandhya Vasan, Supachai Rerks-Ngarm, Punnee Pitisuttithum, Sirinan Madnote, Hathairat Savadsuk, Surawach Rittiroongrad, Jiraporn Puangkaew, Sanjay Phogat, James Tartaglia, Faruk Sinangil, Mark S. de Souza, Jean-Louis Excler, Jerome H.

Interleukin 17 (IL-17)–producing γδ T cells (γδ17 T cells) have been recently found to promote tumor growth and metastasis formation. How such γδ17 T-cell responses may be regulated in the tumor microenvironment remains, however, largely unknown. Here, we report that tumor-associated neutrophils can display an overt antitumor role by strongly suppressing γδ17 T cells. Tumor-associated neutrophils inhibited the proliferation of murine CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells via induction of oxidative stress, thereby preventing them from constituting the major source of pro-tumoral IL-17 in the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that low expression of the antioxidant glutathione in CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T cells renders them particularly susceptible to neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistently, superoxide deficiency, or the administration of a glutathione precursor, rescued CD27&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; Vγ6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ17 T-cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, human Vδ1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; γδ T cells, which contain most γδ17 T cells found in cancer patients, also displayed low glutathione levels and were potently inhibited by ROS. This work thus identifies an unanticipated, immunosuppressive yet antitumoral, neutrophil/ROS/γδ17 T-cell axis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dvsUoCba6KA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Tumor-associated neutrophils suppress pro-tumoral IL-17+ γδ T cells through induction of oxidative stress</title><unread>True</unread><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f4:f3bf0074</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Mensurado, Margarida Rei, Telma Lança, Marianna Ioannou, Natacha Gonçalves-Sousa, Hiroshi Kubo, Marie Malissen, Venizelos Papayannopoulos, Karine Serre, Bruno Silva-Santos&lt;/p&gt;

Whether each NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) has a distinct biological role is not clear. Using superresolution microscopy, we found that NKG2D is constitutively arranged in nanoclusters at the surface of human primary NK cells. Nanoclusters of NKG2D became smaller upon ligation with MICA but became larger upon activation by ULBP2. In addition, ULBP2 induced the reorganization of nanoclusters of the cytokine receptor subunit for both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 (IL-2/IL-15Rβ), such that these cytokine receptor subunits coalesced with nanoclusters of NKG2D. Functionally, the response of NK cells activated by ULBP2 was augmented by an interaction between ULBP2-bound NKG2D and IL-15R ligated by IL-15 (trans-presented by IL-15Rα–coated surfaces). These data suggest that NKG2DLs are not equivalent in their capacity to activate NKG2D and establish a previously unknown paradigm in how ligand-induced changes to the nanoscale organization of the cell surface can affect immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>A nanoscale reorganization of the IL-15 receptor is triggered by NKG2D in a ligand-dependent manner</title><unread>False</unread><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_162b0dce2b7:1f0ff89:923c4a60</id><description>&lt;p&gt;Natural killer group 2D (NKG2D), an activating receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of T cells, recognizes stress-inducible proteins, including MICA and ULBP2, which are present on infected or transformed cells.

These data suggest that NKG2DLs are not equivalent in their capacity to activate NKG2D and establish a previously unknown paradigm in how ligand-induced changes to the nanoscale organization of the cell surface can affect immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1523385688759</crawled><fingerprint>1575514</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/525/eaal3606.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/525/eaal3606?rss=1</originId><published>1523383509000</published><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/525/eaal3606?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>0.8</engagementRate><engagement>49</engagement><author><name>Emmert, M.

The biological properties of essential oils have been demonstrated in the treatment of several diseases and to enhance the bioavailability of other drugs. In natural habitats the essential oils compounds may play important roles in the protection of the plants as antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, insecticides and also against herbivores by reducing their appetite for such plants or by repelling undesirable others.

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Systems (UAV or UAS) have become increasingly popular in recent years for agricultural research applications. UAS are capable of acquiring images with high spatial and temporal resolutions that are ideal for applications in agriculture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a UAS-based remote sensing system for quantification of crop growth parameters of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) including leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and yield. The study was conducted at the Texas A&amp;amp;M Research Farm near College Station, Texas, United States. A fixed-wing UAS equipped with a multispectral sensor was used to collect image data during the 2016 growing season (April–October). Flight missions were successfully carried out at 50 days after planting (DAP; 25 May), 66 DAP (10 June) and 74 DAP (18 June). These flight missions provided image data covering the middle growth period of sorghum with a spatial resolution of approximately 6.5 cm. Field measurements of LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were also collected. Four vegetation indices were calculated using the UAS images. Among those indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed the highest correlation with LAI, f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and yield with R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values of 0.91, 0.89 and 0.58 respectively. Empirical relationships between NDVI and LAI and between NDVI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were validated and proved to be accurate for estimating LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; from UAS-derived NDVI values. NDVI determined from UAS imagery acquired during the flowering stage (74 DAP) was found to be the most highly correlated with final grain yield. The observed high correlations between UAS-derived NDVI and the crop growth parameters (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, LAI and grain yield) suggests the applicability of UAS for within-season data collection of agricultural crops such as sorghum.</content></content><title>Unmanned aerial systems-based remote sensing for monitoring sorghum growth and development</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a60:11c251fd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanaz Shafian, Nithya Rajan, Ronnie Schnell, Muthukumar Bagavathiannan, John Valasek, Yeyin Shi, Jeff Olsenholler&lt;/p&gt;

The observed high correlations between UAS-derived NDVI and the crop growth parameters (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, LAI and grain yield) suggests the applicability of UAS for within-season data collection of agricultural crops such as sorghum.</description><crawled>1525197784057</crawled><fingerprint>fc7497e8</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196605</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196605</originId><published>1525208400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196605</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00032/20180418/images/medium/jp-2018-00032f_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00032&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA. HMR programs provide weekly group coaching to achieve reduced calorie intake, increased fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity ≥2,000 kcal/wk. A Markov model predicted avoidance of diabetes and cardiovascular events and projected cost savings due to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 500 patients included in the analysis, 67% were female and mean age was 54.1 years (s.d. 11.6). The baseline weight and BMI were 243.5 lbs (range 144.0–545.0) and 38.8 kg/m2 (range 25.4–85.0), respectively. Overall, patients lost an average of 47.4 lbs (18.9% of initial body weight [IBW]); the amount of weight loss was consistent among those with diabetes/pre-diabetes (50%), high/moderate risk for dyslipidemia (60%), hypertension/pre-hypertension (86%), and severe obesity (37%). The mean IBW lost was 16.4%, 19.3%, 20.7% for ≤6 months (n = 165), 7–12 months (n = 140), 13–24 months (n = 195) of program participation, respectively. The simulation model estimated 22 diabetes and 30 cardiovascular events and $1,992,370 medical costs avoided over 5 years in the 500 patients evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Patients in the HMR clinic-based HILI program achieved substantial weight loss regardless of duration of program participation, risk profile and comorbid status.

Psychological factors including pain catastrophizing and resilience associate with adjustment and quality of life in people living with chronic pain. Nevertheless, their presentation among females living with HIV and chronic pain has been poorly studied. Given that chronic pain in those living with HIV might occur due to different mechanisms (nociceptive or neuropathic), we hypothesize that the associated psychological states could also differ between these groups. We aimed to compare pain frequency and interference, psychological factors and sleep quality between females living with chronic nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Also, we explored correlations between psychological factors, pain severity and interference in females living with HIV and chronic pain. We performed a cross sectional study assessing females living with HIV and chronic pain, and compared it with a female HIV-positive, pain-free control sample in Brazil. To discriminate the most likely underlying mechanism for the chronic pain, we applied the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms (LANSS). Forty-nine females living with HIV and chronic pain were assessed, and divided in control (n = 12), nociceptive (n = 10) and neuropathic pain (n = 27) groups. Using validated scales, their pain catastrophizing, resilience, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders were assessed between May 2014 and August 2015. Compared to controls, females living with HIV and neuropathic chronic pain had higher pain frequency (p&amp;lt;0.001), interference on activities (p = 0.002), interference with emotions (p&amp;lt;0.001), catastrophizing (p&amp;lt;0.001), depression (p = 0.015), and lower resilience (p = 0.011). Catastrophizing was also significantly correlated to the burden of chronic pain. The type of chronic pain in females living with HIV should raise concerns regarding significant burden in psychological states in this population (particularly neuropathic pain).

Psychological factors including pain catastrophizing and resilience associate with adjustment and quality of life in people living with chronic pain. Nevertheless, their presentation among females living with HIV and chronic pain has been poorly studied. Given that chronic pain in those living with HIV might occur due to different mechanisms (nociceptive or neuropathic), we hypothesize that the associated psychological states could also differ between these groups. We aimed to compare pain frequency and interference, psychological factors and sleep quality between females living with chronic nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Also, we explored correlations between psychological factors, pain severity and interference in females living with HIV and chronic pain. We performed a cross sectional study assessing females living with HIV and chronic pain, and compared it with a female HIV-positive, pain-free control sample in Brazil. To discriminate the most likely underlying mechanism for the chronic pain, we applied the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms (LANSS). Forty-nine females living with HIV and chronic pain were assessed, and divided in control (n = 12), nociceptive (n = 10) and neuropathic pain (n = 27) groups. Using validated scales, their pain catastrophizing, resilience, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders were assessed between May 2014 and August 2015. Compared to controls, females living with HIV and neuropathic chronic pain had higher pain frequency (p&amp;lt;0.001), interference on activities (p = 0.002), interference with emotions (p&amp;lt;0.001), catastrophizing (p&amp;lt;0.001), depression (p = 0.015), and lower resilience (p = 0.011). Catastrophizing was also significantly correlated to the burden of chronic pain. The type of chronic pain in females living with HIV should raise concerns regarding significant burden in psychological states in this population (particularly neuropathic pain). Using scales such as the LANSS to identify the type of choric pain, could be of use to address relevant issues for the patients, and to propose tailored therapies.</description><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><fingerprint>e983082b</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196718</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196718</originId><published>1525294800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196718</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>22</engagement><author><name>Ahneman, D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Developing more effective strategies to prevent relapse remains one of the major challenges of treating substance dependence. Previous studies have identified brain abnormalities in abstinent alcoholics. However, whether these persistent brain deficits in abstinence could predict early relapse to alcohol use has not been well established. This study aimed to identify biomarkers of relapse vulnerability by investigating persistent brain abnormalities in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Brain imaging and impulsive behavior data were collected from 56 abstinent alcohol-dependent male inpatients and 33 age-matched male healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the differences of grey matter volume between the groups. The resting-state functional connectivity was examined using brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. A preliminary prospective study design was used to classify patients into abstainers and relapsers after a 62-day average abstinence period.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared with healthy controls, both relapsers and abstainers exhibited significantly reduced gray matter volume in the cuneus. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that relapsers relative to abstainers demonstrated increased cuneus-centered negative functional connectivity within a network of brain regions which are involved in executive control and salience. Abnormal gray matter volume in the left cuneus and the functional connectivity between the right cuneus and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could successfully predict relapse during the 3-month follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that the abnormal gray matter volume in the cuneus and resting-state cuneus-prefrontal functional connectivity may play an important role in poor treatment outcomes in alcoholics and serve as useful neural markers of relapse vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Combining gray matter volume in the cuneus and the cuneus-prefrontal connectivity may predict early relapse in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4225b:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junkai Wang, Yunli Fan, Yue Dong, Mengying Ma, Yuru Dong, Yajuan Niu, Yin Jiang, Hong Wang, Zhiyan Wang, Liuzhen Wu, Hongqiang Sun, Cailian Cui&lt;/p&gt;

Among patients who survived to ≥30 days, 28,583 (88.2%) survived for greater than one year, whereas 3,837 (11.8%) did not. Variables associated with decreased one-year survival include: increased age, malignancy, number of hospital admissions within the prior year, duration of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive agent use, sepsis, history of congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the need for renal replacement therapy. Numerous effect modifications between these factors were found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Among survivors of critical illness, a significant number survive less than one year.

infarction, more commonly known as heart attack, is a huge health problem
around the world. It is a result of inadequate blood supply to certain parts of
the heart and death of heart muscle cells in that region. Although it has been

is being followed. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology are relatively recent fields
to try to give new insights into myocardial infarction. Following the footsteps
of others, this in silico study has
tried to chime in on the investigation into myocardial infarction. The study
began with the gene expression omnibus dataset uploaded to the NCBI from a whole-genome
gene expression analysis carried out at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
From the dataset, differentially expressed genes following first-time
myocardial infarction were identified and classified into up-regulated and down-regulated
ones. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was carried out on the up-regulated
genes which were statistically significant and corresponded with the NCBI
generated annotations. Protein-Protein Interaction Network for these genes was
constructed. GSEA revealed 5 transcription factors, 5 microRNAs and 3 pathways
significantly associated with them. From the Protein-Protein Interaction
Network, 6 key proteins (hub nodes) have been identified. These 6 proteins may
open a new window of opportunity for the discovery/design of new drugs for mitigating
the damage caused by myocardial infarction.</content></summary><engagement>3</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Identification_of_Key_Proteins_Associated_with_Myocardial_Infarction_using_Bioinformatics_and_Systems_Biology/6185339</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl></origin><title>Identification of Key Proteins Associated with Myocardial Infarction using Bioinformatics and Systems Biology</title><crawled>1524748992959</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163021f41bf:1c764c:4e164c41</id><description>Myocardial
infarction, more commonly known as heart attack, is a huge health problem
around the world. It is a result of inadequate blood supply to certain parts of
the heart and death of heart muscle cells in that region. Although it has been

is being followed. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology are relatively recent fields

Many important applications continuously generate data, such as financial transaction administration, satellite monitoring, network flow monitoring, and web information processing. The data mining results are always evolving with the newly generated data. Obviously, for the clustering task, it is better to incrementally update the new clustering results based on the old data rather than to recluster all of the data from scratch. The incremental clustering approach is an essential way to solve the problem of clustering with growing Big Data. This paper proposes a boundary-profile-based incremental clustering (BPIC) method to find arbitrarily shaped clusters with dynamically growing datasets. This method represents the existing clustering results with a collection of boundary profiles and discards the inner points of clusters rather than keep all data. It greatly saves both time and space storage costs. To identify the boundary profile, this paper presents a boundary-vector-based boundary point detection (BV-BPD) algorithm that summarizes the structure of the existing clusters. The BPIC method processes each new point in an online fashion and updates the clustering results in a batch mode. When a new point arrives, the BPIC method either immediately labels it or temporarily puts it into a bucket according to the relationship between the new data and the boundary profiles. A bucket is employed to distinguish the noise from the potential seeds of new clusters and alleviate the effects of data order. When the bucket is full, the BPIC method will cluster the data within it and update the clustering results. Thus, the BPIC method is insensitive to noise and the order of new data, which is critical for the robustness of the incremental clustering process. In the experiments, the performance of the boundary point detection algorithm BV-BPD is compared with the state-of-the-art method. The results show that the BV-BPD is better than the state-of-the-art method. Additionally, the performance of BPIC and other two incremental clustering methods are investigated in terms of clustering quality, time and space efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the BPIC method is able to get a qualified clustering result on a large dataset with higher time and space efficiency.</content></content><title>An incremental clustering method based on the boundary profile</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e801:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junpeng Bao, Wenqing Wang, Tianshe Yang, Guan Wu&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, acupuncture has gained in popularity worldwide. However, recent epidemiological studies are lacking. We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients who were female, were middle-aged, resided in highly urbanized areas and suffered from injury or disorders of the musculoskeletal system were prone to more frequent acupuncture use. Our study revealed that the utilization of acupuncture became increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. Our findings may provide useful information for clinical practice and research as well as for health policy decision making.</content></content><title>Trends in use of acupuncture among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011: A nationwide population-based study</title><unread>False</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b0:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mei-Yao Wu, Yu-Chen Lee, Cheng-Li Lin, Ming-Cheng Huang, Mao-Feng Sun, Hung-Rong Yen&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis of genomic data (~400,000 autosomal SNPs) enabled the reliable estimation of inbreeding levels in a sample of 541 individuals sampled from a highly admixed Brazilian population isolate (an African-derived &lt;i&gt;quilombo&lt;/i&gt; in the State of São Paulo). To achieve this, different methods were applied to the joint information of two sets of markers (one complete and another excluding loci in patent linkage disequilibrium). This strategy allowed the detection and exclusion of markers that biased the estimation of the average population inbreeding coefficient (Wright’s fixation index &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt;), which value was eventually estimated as around 1% using any of the methods we applied. &lt;i&gt;Quilombo&lt;/i&gt; demographic inferences were made by analyzing the structure of runs of homozygosity (ROH), which were adapted to cope with a highly admixed population with a complex foundation history. Our results suggest that the amount of ROH &amp;lt;2Mb of admixed populations should be somehow proportional to the genetic contribution from each parental population.</content></content><title>Inbreeding estimates in human populations: Applying new approaches to an admixed Brazilian isolate</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb1:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Renan B.

A high-throughput plant phenotyping system automatically observes and grows many plant samples. Many plant sample images are acquired by the system to determine the characteristics of the plants (populations). Stable image acquisition and processing is very important to accurately determine the characteristics. However, hardware for acquiring plant images rapidly and stably, while minimizing plant stress, is lacking. Moreover, most software cannot adequately handle large-scale plant imaging. To address these problems, we developed a new, automated, high-throughput plant phenotyping system using simple and robust hardware, and an automated plant-imaging-analysis pipeline consisting of machine-learning-based plant segmentation. Our hardware acquires images reliably and quickly and minimizes plant stress. Furthermore, the images are processed automatically. In particular, large-scale plant-image datasets can be segmented precisely using a classifier developed using a superpixel-based machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest), and variations in plant parameters (such as area) over time can be assessed using the segmented images. We performed comparative evaluations to identify an appropriate learning algorithm for our proposed system, and tested three robust learning algorithms. We developed not only an automatic analysis pipeline but also a convenient means of plant-growth analysis that provides a learning data interface and visualization of plant growth trends. Thus, our system allows end-users such as plant biologists to analyze plant growth via large-scale plant image data easily.</content></content><title>An automated, high-throughput plant phenotyping system using machine learning-based plant segmentation and image analysis</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d755:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Unseok Lee, Sungyul Chang, Gian Anantrio Putra, Hyoungseok Kim, Dong Hwan Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery programme (ERAS) is an approach to the perioperative care of patients encompassing multiple interventions and involving a wide range of different actors. It can thus be defined as a complex intervention. Despite the strength of the evidence-base in its support, the implementation of ERAS has been slow. This paper specifically explores the utility of Normalization Process Theory (NPT) as a methodological framework to aid exploration of ERAS implementation, with a focus on the core NPT construct &lt;i&gt;coherence&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and materials &lt;p&gt;The study employed qualitative methods guided by NPT. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-six healthcare professionals working in three specialities (thoracic, colorectal, head and neck) in a UK hospital. Data were analysed using an adapted Framework Approach.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coherence&lt;/i&gt;, or sense-making work, was key to successful implementation and demonstrated in the importance of participants believing in ERAS both as an individual and as a team. In order to invest in ERAS individuals needed to be able to differentiate its practices favourably with those enacted pre-implementation (differentiation). Participants also needed to understand their specific tasks and responsibilities (individual specification) and build a shared understanding (communal specification), resolving differences in planning meetings.

Networks in nature rarely function in isolation but instead interact with one another with a form of a network of networks (NoN). A network of networks with interdependency between distinct networks contains instability of abrupt collapse related to the global rule of activation. As a remedy of the collapse instability, here we investigate a model of correlated NoN. We find that the collapse instability can be removed when hubs provide the majority of interconnections and interconnections are convergent between hubs. Thus, our study identifies a stable structure of correlated NoN against catastrophic failures. Our result further suggests a plausible way to enhance network robustness by manipulating connection patterns, along with other methods such as controlling the state of node based on a local rule.</content></content><title>Correlated network of networks enhances robustness against catastrophic failures</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccae:34f43e70</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byungjoon Min, Muhua Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Electroporation of zygotes represents a rapid alternative to the elaborate pronuclear injection procedure for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mice. However, current protocols for electroporation either require the investment in specialized electroporators or corrosive pre-treatment of zygotes which compromises embryo viability. Here, we describe an easily adaptable approach for the introduction of specific mutations in C57BL/6 mice by electroporation of intact zygotes using a common electroporator with synthetic CRISPR/Cas9 components and minimal technical requirement. Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring. Hence, our novel approach for Easy Electroporation of Zygotes (EEZy) allows highly efficient generation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic mice while reducing the numbers of animals required.</content></content><title>An optimized electroporation approach for efficient CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in murine zygotes</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae9:5785ab88</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simon E.

The human brain has the impressive capacity to adapt how it processes information to high-level goals. While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Moreover, our model explained these findings significantly better than an associative learning model and a Win-Stay Lose-Shift model. Our findings elucidate how learning and experience might shape people’s ability and propensity to adaptively control their minds and behavior. We conclude by predicting under which circumstances these learning mechanisms might lead to self-control failure.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Aj4DbuvGLfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Rational metareasoning and the plasticity of cognitive control</title><unread>True</unread><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162fdf4e8f7:3b1d0b:a96d255</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Falk Lieder, Amitai Shenhav, Sebastian Musslick, Thomas L.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;To develop high-quality and safe healthcare, a good safety culture is an important feature of healthcare-providing structures. The objective of this study was to analyze the qualitative data of the comments section of a Hospital Survey on Patient Safety (HSOPS) questionnaire to clarify the answers given to the closed questions.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Using the original data from a cross-sectional survey of 5,064 employees at a single university hospital in France, we conducted a qualitative study by analyzing the comments of a HSOPS survey and conducting in-depth interviews with 19 healthcare providers. We submitted the comments and the interviews to a thematic analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,978 questionnaires were returned, with 247 comments collected. The qualitative analysis identified several structural failures. The main categories of the open comments were concordant with the lowest dimension scores found in the quantitative analysis. The most frequently reported failures were related to the staffing and hospital management support dimensions. The healthcare professionals perceived the lack of resources, including understaffing, as the major barrier to the development of a patient safety culture. Concrete organizational issues related to hospital handoffs and risk coordination were identified, such as transfers from the emergency departments and the lack of feedback following self-reporting of incidents.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The analysis of the open comments complemented the HSOPS scores, increasing the level of detail in the description of the hospital’s patient safety culture. Combined with a classical quantitative approach used in HSOPS-based surveys, the qualitative analysis of open comments is useful to identify organizational weaknesses within the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>The contribution of open comments to understanding the results from the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPS): A qualitative study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f78f9:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bastien Boussat, Kevin Kamalanavin, Patrice François&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Frequent changes in the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) occurring worldwide demand regular surveillance to study their composition and distribution in healthcare facilities. We investigated the genotypic characteristics of MRSA obtained in Kuwait hospitals to better understand their clonal distribution.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,327 MRSA isolates obtained from clinical samples in 13 Kuwait hospitals from 1 January to 31 December 2016 were investigated using antibiogram, SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; typing, spa typing and DNA microarray.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The isolates belonged to six SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; types with the majority belonging to type IV (658; 49.5%) and type V (355; 26.7%). Two hundred and sixty-one spa types were identified with spa types t688, t304, t860, t127, t044, t311, t002, t223, t267, t019, t3841, t005, t084, t852, and t657 constituting 51.0% (n = 677) of the isolates. Among the 1,327 MRSA isolates, 102 (7.68%) isolates were identified as novel variants of internationally recognized MRSA clones. These 102 isolates were investigated further and belonged to 14 clonal complexes (CCs) with CC361 (32; 32.3%), CC30 (15; 14.7%), CC22 (13; 12.7%) and CC1 (11, 10.7%) as the dominant CCs. Eighty-one (79.4%) of the novel isolates harbored SCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; IV or V+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt; composite genetic elements. Four isolates (3.9%) harbored unusual combinations of &lt;i&gt;ccr&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; complexes comprising of CC6-MRSA [IV+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrC&lt;/i&gt;], CC97-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB2&lt;/i&gt;], CC121-MRSA [V/V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;+&lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrB4&lt;/i&gt;] and CC1-MRSA-pseudoSCC&lt;i&gt;mec&lt;/i&gt; [class B mec+&lt;i&gt;fusc&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;i&gt;ccrAB1&lt;/i&gt;]. Forty-six (45.1%) of these isolates were positive for PVL and 89 (87.2%) were resistant to fusidic acid mediated by &lt;i&gt;fusC&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The study showed the emergence of novel variants of previously recognized MRSA genotypes with unusual genetic characteristics including high prevalence of PVL and fusidic acid resistance in Kuwait hospitals.

These findings demonstrate the central role played by HIF-2α in carotid body development, growth and function.</description><crawled>1524138848442</crawled><fingerprint>c3f6587a</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34681</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item></keywords><published>1524096000000</published><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34681</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34681</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Rameshwar U.

Cathepsin B (CTSB), a lysososmal protease involved in cellular degradation process, is recently been studied as a potential candidate gene in the pathogenesis of TCP. According to cathepsin B hypothesis, mutated CTSB can lead to premature intracellular activation of trypsinogen, which is a key regulatory mechanism in pancreatitis. So far, CTSB mutations have been studied in pancreatitis and neurodegenerative disorders but little is known about the structural and functional effect of variants in CTSB. In this study, we investigated the effect of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with TCP, using molecular dynamics and simulation algorithms. There were two non-synonymous variants in the coding region (L26V and S53G) of CTSB, located in the propeptide region. We tried to predict the effect of these variants on structure and function using multiple algorithms: SIFT, Polyphen2, Panther, SDM sever, i-Mutant2.0 suite, mCSM algorithm and Vadar. Further, using databases like miRdbSNP, PolymiRTS and miRNASNP, two SNPs in 3-UTR region were predicted to affect the miRNA binding sites. Structural mutated models of nsSNP mutants (L26V and S53G) were prepared by MODELLER v9.15 and evaluated using TM-Align, Verify 3D, ProSA and Ramachandran plot.

The results from in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these variants in the propeptide region of cathepsin B could lead to structural and functional changes in the protein.

The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania infantum&lt;/i&gt; infection. In contrast, an antibody response against &lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-&lt;i&gt;Lu&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies. Dogs were classified into five groups based on serological and parasitological diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The following linear regression model was fitted: IgG level = mean + origin + sex + age + use of a repellent collar, and the residuals were assumed as pseudo-phenotypes for the association test between phenotypes and genotypes (GWA). A component of variance model that takes into account polygenic and sample structure effects (EMMAX) was employed for GWA. Phenotypic findings indicated that anti-SGH IgG levels remained higher in exposed and subclinically infected dogs than in severely diseased dogs even in regression model residuals. Five associated markers were identified on chromosomes 2, 20 and 31. The mapped genes included &lt;i&gt;CD180&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RP105&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;MITF&lt;/i&gt; related to the rapid activation of B lymphocytes and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The findings pointed to chromosomal segments useful for functional confirmation studies and a search for adjuvant molecules of the anti-saliva response.</content></content><title>Canine leishmaniasis: Genome-wide analysis and antibody response to &amp;lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&amp;lt;/i&gt; saliva</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee9:2835af05</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luís F.

Background &lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorders (AUD) in older people have been the subject of increasing interest in Europe and worldwide. However, thus far, no reliable data exist regarding the prevalence of AUD in people over the age of 65 years in Europe.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the current (past month), 12-month and lifetime prevalence of alcohol use, abuse and dependence in people aged 65–84 years.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;The MentDis_ICF65+ study was a representative stepwise cross-sectional survey that was conducted in six European and associated cities (Hamburg, Germany; Ferrara, Italy; London/Canterbury, England; Madrid, Spain; Geneva, Switzerland and Jerusalem, Israel).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;In total, 3,142 community-dwelling people aged between 65 and 84 years who lived in participating cities were assessed with an age-sensitive diagnostic interview (CIDI65+).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of lifetime alcohol use was 81% for the overall sample. The observed AUD (DSM-IV-TR) prevalence was as follows: current, 1.1%; 12-month, 5.3% and lifetime, 8.8%. Alcohol consumption and AUD were more prevalent in males, and a significant interaction between gender and city was observed; greater gender differences in the prevalence of these disorders were observed in Hamburg, London/Canterbury and Geneva in comparison to the other cities. The prevalence of lifetime alcohol consumption and 12-month AUD tended to be lower in older persons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results highlight the appropriateness of using age-adjusted diagnostic tools (CIDI65+) to identify alcohol use and AUD in older people. Different alcohol use patterns were observed in males and females. The results seem to indicate the presence of different alcohol use patterns between northern and southern European countries. Specialized services are proposed, including brief and/or more intensive interventions framed intensive and more simple interventions framed in stepped care strategies, to improve the social and health resources available for older people across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Alcohol use, abuse and dependence in an older European population: Results from the MentDis_ICF65+ study</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e51:fc1f8953</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Manuel Muñoz, Berta Ausín, Ana B.

Alcohol consumption and AUD were more prevalent in males, and a significant interaction between gender and city was observed; greater gender differences in the prevalence of these disorders were observed in Hamburg, London/Canterbury and Geneva in comparison to the other cities. The prevalence of lifetime alcohol consumption and 12-month AUD tended to be lower in older persons.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results highlight the appropriateness of using age-adjusted diagnostic tools (CIDI65+) to identify alcohol use and AUD in older people. Different alcohol use patterns were observed in males and females. The results seem to indicate the presence of different alcohol use patterns between northern and southern European countries. Specialized services are proposed, including brief and/or more intensive interventions framed intensive and more simple interventions framed in stepped care strategies, to improve the social and health resources available for older people across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1525111386036</crawled><fingerprint>85f73c16</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196574</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196574</originId><published>1525122000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196574</link></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>A diverse array of species on the planet employ the Earth&apos;s magnetic field as a navigational aid.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the photochemical degradation of trypan blue (TB) and to identify decomposition products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Defined solution samples of TB and a mixture with lutein/zeaxanthin were exposed to blue light. Thermal degradation processes were ruled out using controls not subjected to irradiation. All samples were analyzed using optical microscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Degradation kinetics were determined based on changes in absorbance; intermediates were identified by analyzing mass differences of characteristic fragment ion peaks within the fragmentation patterns, and assignments were verified by NMR.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photochemical degradation, which can be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin. Intermediates vary depending on the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin. The self-sensitized photodegradation of TB occurs under generation of dimethyl sulfate and presumed formation of phenol. In contrast, within the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin the decomposition of TB indicates the formation of methoxyamine and sulfonyl arin. Thermal degradation processes were not observed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photodegradation that may be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin and results in the formation of cytotoxic decomposition products. Our findings contribute to understand degradation mechanisms of TB and may elucidate previous clinical and experimental observations of cellular toxicity after TB application.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Photochemical degradation of trypan blue</title><unread>False</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c8:9aea0a7d</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias Brockmann, Véronique Blanchard, Philipp Heretsch, Claudia Brockmann, Eckart Bertelmann&lt;/p&gt;

d-Tagatose has gained substantial interest due to its potential functionalities as a sucrose substitute. In this study, the gene &lt;i&gt;araA&lt;/i&gt;, encoding l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) from &lt;i&gt;Clostridium hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; (DSM 15053), was cloned and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; BL21 (DE3). This gene consists of 1,506 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 501 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56,554 Da. Since l-AI was expressed as an intracellular inclusion body, this enzyme was solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride, refolded, and activated with a descending concentration gradient of urea. The purified enzyme exhibited the greatest activity at 50°C, pH 7–7.5, and required 1 mM of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor. Notably, the catalytic efficiency (3.69 mM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) of l-AI from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; on galactose was significantly greater than that of other previously reported enzymes. The bioconversion yield of d-tagatose using the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; l-arabinose isomerase at 60°C reached approximately 46% from 10 mM of d-galactose after 2 h. From these results, it is suggested that the l-arabinose isomerase from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; could be utilized as a potential enzyme for d-tagatose production due to its high conversion yield at an industrially competitive temperature.</content></content><title>Biochemical properties of L-arabinose isomerase from &amp;lt;i&gt;Clostridium hylemonae&amp;lt;/i&gt; to produce D-tagatose as a functional sweetener</title><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb95:7d6c1c1c</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tien-Kieu Nguyen, Moon-Gi Hong, Pahn-Shick Chang, Byung-Hoo Lee, Sang-Ho Yoo&lt;/p&gt;
