Overall, subgenome-classification approaches tend to perform better than standard approaches with EAGLE-RC having the highest precision.</description><author><name>Kuo, T.</name></author><fingerprint>8de67730</fingerprint><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/426437v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_165cd16e011:28f6c3:6f86c10b</id><published>1536735600000</published><unread>True</unread><entities><item><label>MDS - L cell line</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/mds - l cell line</id><mentions><item><text>MDS - L cell line</text></item><item><text>MDS</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>CD34</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/CD34</id><mentions><item><text>CD34+</text></item><item><text>CD34</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Lin</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/lin</id><mentions><item><text>Lin</text></item><item><text>lin</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>CD38</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/CD38</id><mentions><item><text>CD38</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>d</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/d</id><mentions><item><text>d</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characterization and targeting of malignant stem cells in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndromes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characterization and targeting of malignant stem cells in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndromes, Published online: 12 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05984-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05984-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) arises from mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).

These results comprise the most wide‐ranging study to date correlating force fields to structural changes in the cellular prion protein. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_165d4226a67:d8db17:4db7ac35</id><published>1536860251000</published><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6407/1084-g?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>1</engagement><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6407/1084-g?rss=1</originId><title>Specialized chaperones required</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1536862349927</crawled><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6407/1084-g?rss=1</link><author><name>Funk, M.

Bacterial and human voltage-gated sodium channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;s) exhibit similar cation selectivity, despite their distinct EEEE and DEKA selectivity filter signature sequences. Recent high-resolution structures for bacterial Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;s have allowed us to learn about ion conduction mechanisms in these simpler homo-tetrameric channels, but our understanding of the function of their mammalian counterparts remains limited. To probe these conduction mechanisms, a model of the human Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channel has been constructed by grafting residues of its selectivity filter and external vestibular region onto the bacterial Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;Rh channel with atomic-resolution structure. Multi-μs fully atomistic simulations capture long time-scale ion and protein movements associated with the permeation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and their differences. We observe a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion knock-on conduction mechanism facilitated by low energy multi-carboxylate/multi-Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, akin to the bacterial channels. These complexes involve both the DEKA and vestibular EEDD rings, acting to draw multiple Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the selectivity filter and promote permeation. When the DEKA ring lysine is protonated, we observe that its ammonium group is actively participating in Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; permeation, presuming the role of another ion. It participates in the formation of a stable complex involving carboxylates that collectively bind both Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the Lys ammonium group in a high-field strength site, permitting pass-by translocation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In contrast, multiple K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion complexes with the DEKA and EEDD rings are disfavored by up to 8.3 kcal/mol, with the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-lysine-carboxylate complex non-existent. As a result, lysine acts as an electrostatic plug that partially blocks the flow of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which must instead wait for isomerization of lysine downward to clear the path for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; passage. These distinct mechanisms give us insight into the nature of ion conduction and selectivity in human Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; channels, while uncovering high field strength carboxylate binding complexes that define the more general phenomenon of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective ion transport in nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/67OG9qpOaY0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Selective ion permeation involves complexation with carboxylates and lysine in a model human sodium channel</title><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>320</width><height>520</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><url>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006398.g001</url></visual><crawled>1536774904365</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006398</link><updateCount>1</updateCount><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Emelie Flood</name></author><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006398</originId><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emelie Flood, Céline Boiteux, Toby W.

Our results implicate warm-to-cool climatic oscillations as a trigger for adaptive radiation and refute arguments attributing Pleistocene megafaunal extinction to aridity-forced dietary change.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6410/72.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><fingerprint>304feb4e</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1664044f5cc:3a25a9d:f06daea</id><published>1538674742000</published><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/362/6410/eaat2382?rss=1</href></item></alternate><crawled>1538676553164</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/362/6410/eaat2382?rss=1</originId><title>Chemical interactions between Saturns atmosphere and its rings</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><keywords><item>Atmospheric Science, Online Only, Planetary Science</item></keywords><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/362/6410/eaat2382?rss=1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft made close-up measurements of Saturn’s ionosphere and upper atmosphere in the 1970s and 1980s that suggested a chemical interaction between the rings and atmosphere.

Variation of an inherited trait across a population cannot be explained by additive contributions of relevant genes, due to epigenetic effects and biochemical interactions (epistasis). Detecting epistasis in genomic data still represents a significant challenge that requires a better understanding of epistasis from the mechanistic point of view. Using a standard Wright-Fisher model of bi-allelic asexual population, we study how compensatory epistasis affects the process of adaptation. The main result is a universal relationship between four haplotype frequencies of a single site pair in a genome, which depends only on the epistasis strength of the pair defined regarding Darwinian fitness. We demonstrate the existence, at any time point, of a quasi-equilibrium between epistasis and disorder (entropy) caused by random genetic drift and mutation. We verify the accuracy of these analytic results by Monte-Carlo simulation over a broad range of parameters, including the topology of the interacting network. Thus, epistasis assists the evolutionary transit through evolutionary hurdles leaving marks at the level of haplotype disequilibrium.

Rouzine&lt;/p&gt;
Variation of an inherited trait across a population cannot be explained by additive contributions of relevant genes, due to epigenetic effects and biochemical interactions (epistasis). Detecting epistasis in genomic data still represents a significant challenge that requires a better understanding of epistasis from the mechanistic point of view. Using a standard Wright-Fisher model of bi-allelic asexual population, we study how compensatory epistasis affects the process of adaptation. The main result is a universal relationship between four haplotype frequencies of a single site pair in a genome, which depends only on the epistasis strength of the pair defined regarding Darwinian fitness. We demonstrate the existence, at any time point, of a quasi-equilibrium between epistasis and disorder (entropy) caused by random genetic drift and mutation. We verify the accuracy of these analytic results by Monte-Carlo simulation over a broad range of parameters, including the topology of the interacting network. Thus, epistasis assists the evolutionary transit through evolutionary hurdles leaving marks at the level of haplotype disequilibrium. The method allows determining selection coefficient for each site and the epistasis strength of each pair from a sequence set. The resulting ability to detect clusters of deleterious mutation close to full compensation is essential for biomedical applications. These findings help to understand the role of epistasis in multiple compensatory mutations in viral resistance to antivirals and immune response.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uu1bJnHITJI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165c27784c2:1574902:6f86c10b</id><published>1536562800000</published><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Recent technologies are generating an abundance of genome sequence data and molecular and clinical phenotype data, providing an opportunity to understand the genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms underlying diseases.

Well, I realize that’s true of a lot of things, but it’s especially true in progress against disease, and that’s especially especially true (as I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/01/14/the-sad-state-of-human-dietary-research&quot;&gt;said here before&lt;/a&gt;) when you’re talking about dietary influences and what can be learned from them. Butter, whole milk, and other dairy products – bad for your cardiovascular health, right? Not according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31812-9/fulltext&quot;&gt;this new observational study&lt;/a&gt; of 136,000 people across 21 countries. In fact, they found the opposite: higher dairy consumption was associated &lt;em&gt;with a cardiovascular benefit&lt;/em&gt;. OK, salt consumption, at most any level, is associated with high blood pressure, right? Not according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31376-X/fulltext&quot;&gt;this new study&lt;/a&gt; on 97,000 patients: the only correlation was seen with people who consumed &lt;em&gt;over 5 grams per day&lt;/em&gt; of sodium (current guidelines sound the alarm at 2g and lower). Probiotics help to restore your gut flora after taking antibiotics, right? Not according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)31108-5&quot;&gt;this new study&lt;/a&gt; on both mice and humans: treatment with a standard probiotic mix &lt;em&gt;actually slowed down&lt;/em&gt; the reconstitution of the previous microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, dietary science is a mess – at least we can all agree on that. How about we shift over to a population of patients with a clearly defined disease? Omega-3 fatty acids are supposed to be good for cardiovascular health, right? And diabetic patients most definitely have a higher cardiovascular risk, so how about supplementing them? This new study looked at 15,480 diabetic patients without pre-existing cardiovascular trouble who got either omega-3 fatty acids or were given olive oil capsules as control. Over 7 years of observations – &lt;em&gt;no significant difference&lt;/em&gt; between the two cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, enough dietary stuff in general. Let’s talk about giving specific compounds to patients and get some clarity, OK? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac&quot;&gt;Diclofenac&lt;/a&gt; is the most widely prescribed NSAID in the world, so it should be safe, right? Not according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3426&quot;&gt;this new study&lt;/a&gt; observing the &lt;em&gt;entire population of Denmark&lt;/em&gt; over a twenty-year period. Unfortunately, the adverse event rate among those starting diclofenac &lt;em&gt;went up by 50%&lt;/em&gt;, after controlling for everything else the authors could reasonably control for (take ibuprofen instead!) All right then, giving low-dose aspirin to older patients at risk for cardiovascular events is beneficial, right? Not according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31924-X/fulltext&quot;&gt;this new study&lt;/a&gt; on 6200 moderate-risk patients (with 6200 in the control group), which found no meaningful differences in adverse events. And definitely not according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1803955&quot;&gt;this new study&lt;/a&gt; with 9500 patients in each group – they also saw no benefit, but also report slightly &lt;em&gt;higher mortality&lt;/em&gt; in the aspirin treatment group, apparently due to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now. I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen consensus medical advice take such a beating in such a short time (thanks to Eric Topol on Twitter for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1041361606976856064&quot;&gt;mentioning&lt;/a&gt; the whole range of these). I have no reason to celebrate any of these results, other than celebrating new and powerful data, which should always be welcome. But what all this does is illustrate just how tricky this whole business is. Aspirin! How long have we been recommending low-dose aspirin? And apparently not only recommending it to no avail, but quite possibly causing actual harm besides. Now, it may well be that in patients who have already experienced a cardiovascular event that low-dose aspirin may be worthwhile. But in the general population? Apparently not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m not just going to moan about how complicated everything is and how hard it is to get good answers. Both of those are true, big-time, but there’s actually something to celebrate here, odd as that may sound. What we’re seeing here is actual progress in human scientific knowledge, in all its messy infuriating glory. We know more than we did before. We’ve learned something. Even if you’re not sure about the situation in all of the cases mentioned above, what we’ve found is that you can (at the very least) run large well-executed trials and not get the results you’d expect, which is certainly something to think about. Science really does march on, and sometimes it steps on things along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1537365510000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/09/19/a-run-of-contrary-results</href></item></alternate><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13829</originId><title>A Run of Contrary Results</title><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>346</width><height>440</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><url>http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/covers/sci/361/6407/-F1.medium.gif</url></visual><keywords><item>Cancer</item><item>Cardiovascular Disease</item><item>Clinical Trials</item></keywords><updateCount>1</updateCount><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><origin><title>Sciencemag</title><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl></origin><description>From the outside, medical progress looks a lot easier than it really is.

This strategy affords control over the initiation and duration of convective mixing, providing a tool for thermal automation of biochemical reactions with efficient reaction kinetics.</description></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_165fb69c895:180e581:4c71e4fe</id><published>1537513200000</published><unread>True</unread><entities><item><label>Computed Tomography for Space</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/computed tomography for space</id><mentions><item><text>Computed Tomography for Space</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>HV</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/hv</id><mentions><item><text>HV</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Carbon nanotube</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Carbon nanotube</id><mentions><item><text>carbon nanotube</text></item><item><text>CNT</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>kVp</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/kvp</id><mentions><item><text>kVp</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Quantitative easing</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Quantitative easing</id><mentions><item><text>QE</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stationary Computed Tomography for Space and other Resource-constrained Environments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stationary Computed Tomography for Space and other Resource-constrained Environments, Published online: 21 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32505-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32505-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stationary Computed Tomography for Space and other Resource-constrained Environments&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-us-Asl9rr8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/-us-Asl9rr8/s41598-018-32505-z</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32505-z</href></item></canonical><engagement>1</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32505-z</originId><title>Stationary Computed Tomography for Space and other Resource-constrained Environments</title><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><height>260</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-32505-z/MediaObjects/41598_2018_32505_Fig1_HTML.png</url></visual><crawled>1537521338517</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32505-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stationary Computed Tomography for Space and other Resource-constrained Environments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stationary Computed Tomography for Space and other Resource-constrained Environments, Published online: 21 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32505-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32505-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stationary Computed Tomography for Space and other Resource-constrained Environments&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-us-Asl9rr8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><author><name>Avilash Cramer</name></author><fingerprint>b0cf352</fingerprint><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_165f2c86e55:bea714:6f86c10b</id><published>1537340400000</published><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Put to sleep by immune cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put to sleep by immune cells, Published online: 19 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06666-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06666-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The sleep disorder narcolepsy is linked to immune-system genes and is caused by the loss of neurons that express the protein hypocretin.

Here, we present SimulateCNVs, the first software application that can simulate CNVs in both WES and WGS data, which is easy to install, has many unique features and can output rearranged genomes, short reads and bam files in a single command.

This framework provides insight into the specific role of hot carriers in plasmon-mediated photochemistry, which is critically important for designing energy-efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6410/69.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_165d4226a67:d8db25:4db7ac35</id><published>1536860251000</published><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6407/1083-k?rss=1</href></item></alternate><crawled>1536862349927</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6407/1083-k?rss=1</originId><title>Steering together all four Ugi pieces</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6407/1083-k?rss=1</link><engagement>1</engagement><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><fingerprint>f515e6ae</fingerprint><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1083.11.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1663e744989:387710a:19b4cc1a</id><published>1538636400000</published><unread>True</unread><entities><item><label>PB</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/pb</id><mentions><item><text>PB</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>FLUKA MC</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/fluka mc</id><mentions><item><text>FLUKA MC</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>TPS</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/tps</id><mentions><item><text>TPS</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>TG</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/tg</id><mentions><item><text>TG</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>DG</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/dg</id><mentions><item><text>DG</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item></entities><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fast robust dose calculation on GPU for high-precision &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O ion therapy: the FRoG platform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast robust dose calculation on GPU for high-precision &amp;lt;sup&gt;1&amp;lt;/sup&gt;H, &amp;lt;sup&gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&gt;He, &amp;lt;sup&gt;12&amp;lt;/sup&gt;C and &amp;lt;sup&gt;16&amp;lt;/sup&gt;O ion therapy: the FRoG platform, Published online: 04 October 2018;

This work reveals how histones are inherited to sister chromatids and identifies a mechanism by which the replication machinery ensures symmetric cell division.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6409/1389.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1661a53cac6:799139:f06daea</id><published>1538031600000</published><unread>True</unread><entities><item><label>cfu BCG</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/cfu bcg</id><mentions><item><text>cfu</text></item><item><text>cfu BCG</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>TTP</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/ttp</id><mentions><item><text>TTP</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>PANTA</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/panta</id><mentions><item><text>PANTA</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>OADC</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/oadc</id><mentions><item><text>OADC</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>IGRA</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/igra</id><mentions><item><text>IGRA</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immunological correlates of mycobacterial growth inhibition describe a spectrum of tuberculosis infection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunological correlates of mycobacterial growth inhibition describe a spectrum of tuberculosis infection, Published online: 27 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32755-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32755-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Immunological correlates of mycobacterial growth inhibition describe a spectrum of tuberculosis infection&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/XYodbSObbt4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/XYodbSObbt4/s41598-018-32755-x</href></item></alternate><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32755-x</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32755-x</originId><title>Immunological correlates of mycobacterial growth inhibition describe a spectrum of tuberculosis infection</title><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><height>491</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-32755-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_32755_Fig1_HTML.png</url></visual><crawled>1538039990982</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32755-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immunological correlates of mycobacterial growth inhibition describe a spectrum of tuberculosis infection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunological correlates of mycobacterial growth inhibition describe a spectrum of tuberculosis infection, Published online: 27 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32755-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32755-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Immunological correlates of mycobacterial growth inhibition describe a spectrum of tuberculosis infection&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/XYodbSObbt4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><author><name>Matthew K.

Recent advances in epigenomics have made it possible to map genome-wide regulatory regions using empirical methods. Subsequent comparative epigenomic studies have revealed that regulatory regions diverge rapidly between genome of different species, and that the divergence is more pronounced in enhancers than in promoters. To understand genomic changes underlying these patterns, we investigated if we can identify specific sequence fragments that are over-enriched in regulatory regions, thus potentially contributing to regulatory functions of such regions. Here we report numerous sequence fragments that are statistically over-enriched in enhancers and promoters of different mammals (which we refer to as ‘sequence determinants’). Interestingly, the degree of statistical enrichment, which presumably is associated with the degree of regulatory impacts of the specific sequence determinant, was significantly higher for promoter sequence determinants than enhancer sequence determinants. We further used a machine learning method to construct prediction models using sequence determinants. Remarkably, prediction models constructed from one species could be used to predict regulatory regions of other species with high accuracy. This observation indicates that even though the precise locations of regulatory regions diverge rapidly during evolution, the functional potential of sequence determinants underlying regulatory sequences may be conserved between species.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q4TbfATi4e4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Functional conservation of sequence determinants at rapidly evolving regulatory regions across mammals</title><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>320</width><height>142</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><url>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006451.t001</url></visual><crawled>1538762225213</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006451</link><updateCount>1</updateCount><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Iksoo Huh</name></author><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006451</originId><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Iksoo Huh, Isabel Mendizabal, Taesung Park, Soojin V.

Many research questions in visual perception involve determining whether stimulus properties are represented and processed independently. In visual neuroscience, there is great interest in determining whether important object dimensions are represented independently in the brain. For example, theories of face recognition have proposed either completely or partially independent processing of identity and emotional expression. Unfortunately, most previous research has only vaguely defined what is meant by “independence,” which hinders its precise quantification and testing. This article develops a new quantitative framework that links signal detection theory from psychophysics and encoding models from computational neuroscience, focusing on a special form of independence defined in the psychophysics literature: perceptual separability. The new theory allowed us, for the first time, to precisely define separability of neural representations and to theoretically link behavioral and brain measures of separability. The framework formally specifies the relation between these different levels of perceptual and brain representation, providing the tools for a truly integrative research approach. In particular, the theory identifies exactly what valid inferences can be made about independent encoding of stimulus dimensions from the results of multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data and psychophysical studies. In addition, commonly used operational tests of independence are re-interpreted within this new theoretical framework, providing insights on their correct use and interpretation. Finally, we apply this new framework to the study of separability of brain representations of face identity and emotional expression (neutral/sad) in a human fMRI study with male and female participants.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qnPjy-Per_4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Linking signal detection theory and encoding models to reveal independent neural representations from neuroimaging data</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1538415902955</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006470</link><updateCount>1</updateCount><author><name>Fabian A.

Computational models predicting symptomatic progression at the individual level can be highly beneficial for early intervention and treatment planning for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Individual prognosis is complicated by many factors including the definition of the prediction objective itself. In this work, we present a computational framework comprising machine-learning techniques for 1) modeling symptom trajectories and 2) prediction of symptom trajectories using multimodal and longitudinal data. We perform primary analyses on three cohorts from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and a replication analysis using subjects from Australian Imaging, Biomarker &amp;amp; Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). We model the prototypical symptom trajectory classes using clinical assessment scores from mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-13) at nine timepoints spanned over six years based on a hierarchical clustering approach. Subsequently we predict these trajectory classes for a given subject using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, genetic, and clinical variables from two timepoints (baseline + follow-up). For prediction, we present a longitudinal Siamese neural-network (LSN) with novel architectural modules for combining multimodal data from two timepoints. The trajectory modeling yields two (stable and decline) and three (stable, slow-decline, fast-decline) trajectory classes for MMSE and ADAS-13 assessments, respectively. For the predictive tasks, LSN offers highly accurate performance with 0.900 accuracy and 0.968 AUC for binary MMSE task and 0.760 accuracy for 3-way ADAS-13 task on ADNI datasets, as well as, 0.724 accuracy and 0.883 AUC for binary MMSE task on replication AIBL dataset.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RcadvnqgjYY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Modeling and prediction of clinical symptom trajectories in Alzheimer’s disease using longitudinal data</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1536946746037</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006376</link><updateCount>1</updateCount><author><name>Nikhil Bhagwat</name></author><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006376</originId><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nikhil Bhagwat, Joseph D.

The nucleus vs. the cytosol (and the cell membrane itself) are the two most obvious partitions, and then you have specialized organelles like the mitochondria, &lt;em&gt;et&lt;/em&gt; very much &lt;em&gt;cetera&lt;/em&gt;, dividing things further. Life itself is organized around things being different on one side of a membrane as compared to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider what happens when DNA (double-stranded) shows up in the cytosol, as opposed to its homeland inside the nuclear membrane. It’s just not supposed to be there, and its presence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3683625/&quot;&gt;gets interpreted&lt;/a&gt; as a sign of infectious attack, triggering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system&quot;&gt;innate immune system&lt;/a&gt;. That’s fine, most of the time, but there are complications with the immune system as a whole: people with some autoimmune diseases (the classic example is lupus) often &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-dsDNA_antibodies&quot;&gt;display antibodies&lt;/a&gt; to dsDNA, probably inappropriate ones, and one theory is that there’s some sort of defect in apoptosis that allows leakage of (incompletely destroyed) endogenous dsDNA to the point that it raises an immune response. In general, you probably don’t want to set the immune system loose on your own genome – or on anything endogenous, for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do cells pick up on wandering bits of cytosolic DNA at all? In recent years, that’s become more clear. There’s a nucleotidyltransferase enzyme called cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) that binds to cytosolic DNA and immediately starts synthesizing cGAMP when it does. That’s a second messenger that in turn &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGAS%E2%80%93STING_cytosolic_DNA_sensing_pathway&quot;&gt;activates&lt;/a&gt; another protein called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulator_of_interferon_genes&quot;&gt;STING&lt;/a&gt; (stimulator of interferon genes), which is involved in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004891/&quot;&gt;host of cellular responses&lt;/a&gt; to trouble. This whole system is of great interest in drug discovery, naturally, with people in immunology, infectious disease, and cancer all piling into the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6403/704&quot;&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; that illuminates how all this works (commentary &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6403/646&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and guess what? It’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;condensate time&lt;/a&gt; again. Previous work had already shown that cGAS/DNA complexes were organized into oligomers, but it now looks like these things come out of cytosolic solution entirely into small phase-separated droplets. These contain activated cGAS, and can combine with other such droplets as they come into proximity. ATP, GTP, and cGAMP rapidly diffuse in (and out) of the separate phase, and the degree of cGAS activity correlates with the amount of phase separation. The high concentrations in the new phase enhances the enzyme activity, apparently. The degree of phase separation, in turn, depends on the length of the dsDNA (a hot area of research &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30794-3&quot;&gt;all its own&lt;/a&gt;). Another factor in the ease of condensate formation is the concentration of zinc ions, and the authors suggest that this might be a regulatory mechanism for immune sensitivity. Most interestingly, RNA and single-stranded DNA can also cause a phase separation, but the cGAS in those droplets is not active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This (like a lot of other recent condensate work) raises a whole host of new questions while it answer some others. Are there different sorts of cGAS droplets (other than dsDNA-active versus RNA/ssDNA inactive ones?) Is that zinc ion idea correct, and are there other cytosolic regulators of condensate formation? Do problems with these determine sensitivity to autoimmune responses? Even bigger: what other cytosolic enzymes work this way? Do such phase droplets, under some conditions, come down and stick to the surfaces inside the cell (the ER, nuclear membrane, mitrochondrial membanes, inner cell membrane), perhaps piling up concentrations of signaling molecules against receptors, or altering membrane properties in general?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more, I think it’s possible that we’re in the middle of rewriting the cell biology textbooks, so strap in. There will be a lot of crappy papers published in this area along with the good ones, to be sure, and claims will be made that don’t hold up. The hotness and trendiness will get on people’s nerves, and there will be fights for recognition and credit. But all of this is science. And there’s a lot of science going on around this idea right now.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><origin><title>Sciencemag</title><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/09/11/switching-on-innate-immunity</canonicalUrl><description>Cells couldn’t have a hope of working if they weren’t tightly spatially organized.

However, to adopt a more precision approach that integrates individual variability including omics data into risk assessments, diagnoses, and therapeutic decision making, whole transcriptome expression analysis requires methodological advancements. One need is for users to confidently be able to make individual-level inferences from whole transcriptome data. We propose that biological replicates in isogenic conditions can provide a framework for testing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in a single subject (ss) in absence of an appropriate external reference standard or replicates. Methods: Eight ss methods for identifying genes with differential expression (NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, mixture model, DESeq, DESeq2, iDEG, and ensemble) were compared in Yeast (parental line versus snf2 deletion mutant; n=42/condition) and MCF7 breast-cancer cell (baseline and stimulated with estradiol; n=7/condition) RNA-Seq datasets where replicate analysis was used to build reference standards from NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2. Each dataset was randomly partitioned so that approximately two-thirds of the paired samples were used to construct reference standards and the remainder were treated separately as single-subject sample pairs and DEGs were assayed using ss methods. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall plots were determined for all ss methods against each RSs in both datasets (525 combinations). Results: Consistent with prior analyses of these data, ~50% and ~15% DEGs were respectively obtained in Yeast and MCF7 reference standard datasets regardless of the analytical method. NOISeq, edgeR and DESeq were the most concordant and robust methods for creating a reference standard. Single-subject versions of NOISeq, DEGseq, and an ensemble learner achieved the best median ROC-area-under-the-curve to compare two transcriptomes without replicates regardless of the type of reference standard (&gt;90% in Yeast, &gt;0.75 in MCF7). Conclusion: Better and more consistent accuracies are obtained by an ensemble method applied to single-subject studies across different conditions. In addition, distinct specific sing-subject methods perform better according to different proportions of DEGs. Single-subject methods for identifying DEGs from paired samples need improvement, as no method performs with both precision&gt;90% and recall&gt;90%. http://www.lussiergroup.org/publications/EnsembleBiomarker</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/27/428581</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/428581v1?rss=1</originId><title>Evaluating single-subject study methods for personal transcriptomic interpretations to advance precision medicine [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1538079049965</crawled><description>Background: Gene expression profiling has benefited medicine by providing clinically relevant insights at the molecular candidate and systems levels.

Methods: Eight ss methods for identifying genes with differential expression (NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, mixture model, DESeq, DESeq2, iDEG, and ensemble) were compared in Yeast (parental line versus snf2 deletion mutant; n=42/condition) and MCF7 breast-cancer cell (baseline and stimulated with estradiol; n=7/condition) RNA-Seq datasets where replicate analysis was used to build reference standards from NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2. Each dataset was randomly partitioned so that approximately two-thirds of the paired samples were used to construct reference standards and the remainder were treated separately as single-subject sample pairs and DEGs were assayed using ss methods. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall plots were determined for all ss methods against each RSs in both datasets (525 combinations). Results: Consistent with prior analyses of these data, ~50% and ~15% DEGs were respectively obtained in Yeast and MCF7 reference standard datasets regardless of the analytical method. NOISeq, edgeR and DESeq were the most concordant and robust methods for creating a reference standard. Single-subject versions of NOISeq, DEGseq, and an ensemble learner achieved the best median ROC-area-under-the-curve to compare two transcriptomes without replicates regardless of the type of reference standard (&gt;90% in Yeast, &gt;0.75 in MCF7). Conclusion: Better and more consistent accuracies are obtained by an ensemble method applied to single-subject studies across different conditions. In addition, distinct specific sing-subject methods perform better according to different proportions of DEGs. Single-subject methods for identifying DEGs from paired samples need improvement, as no method performs with both precision&gt;90% and recall&gt;90%. http://www.lussiergroup.org/publications/EnsembleBiomarker</description><author><name>Rachid Zaim, S.</name></author><fingerprint>5a609b0</fingerprint><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/428581v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_165f866ea94:1465db4:6f86c10b</id><published>1537426800000</published><unread>True</unread><entities><item><label>Los Angeles Rams</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Los Angeles Rams</id><mentions><item><text>rams</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Max Wyss</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/max wyss</id><mentions><item><text>Max Wyss</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Eurasian Plate</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Eurasian Plate</id><mentions><item><text>Eurasian plate</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>International Centre for Earth Simulation Foundation</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/international centre for earth simulation foundation</id><mentions><item><text>International Centre for Earth Simulation Foundation</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>India</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/India</id><mentions><item><text>Indian</text></item><item><text>India</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The multitasking cell that can build the parts of a human skeleton&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multitasking cell that can build the parts of a human skeleton, Published online: 20 September 2018;

In this paper we review the MPEG-G standard in more detail, as well as the main advantages and functionalities offered by it.</description><author><name>Alberti, C.</name></author><fingerprint>cadf0a95</fingerprint><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/426353v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_165a4e82c5e:2b71241:b99eedab</id><published>1536044400000</published><unread>False</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Five steps to improve air-quality forecasts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five steps to improve air-quality forecasts, Published online: 04 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06150-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06150-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A worldwide monitoring and modelling network would reduce the dramatic toll of air pollution on health and food production, urge Rajesh Kumar and colleagues.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06150-5</href></item></alternate><engagement>14</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06150-5</originId><title>Five steps to improve air-quality forecasts</title><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06150-5/d41586-018-06150-5_16085024.jpg</url></visual><crawled>1536070003806</crawled><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06150-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Five steps to improve air-quality forecasts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five steps to improve air-quality forecasts, Published online: 04 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06150-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06150-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A worldwide monitoring and modelling network would reduce the dramatic toll of air pollution on health and food production, urge Rajesh Kumar and colleagues.</description><author><name>Rajesh Kumar</name></author><fingerprint>9b890d0a</fingerprint><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165eda8c8c3:42026d:6f86c10b</id><published>1537254000000</published><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/420562v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Long non-coding RNA expression data has been increasingly used in finding diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer studies.

And you’ll find people who are willing to stretch the truth in any way that they find necessary to get in on the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/09/08/reynolds/35RHC37SsgbmtSgn0N9zxN/story.html&quot;&gt;what this article&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; details. It’s on Frank Reynolds, founder of InVivo Therapeutics, who are testing a new surgical adjunct to spinal cord injury. Reynolds had a dramatic story of working his way back after such an injury himself, coming out of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/20100301/what-makes-frank-run.html&quot;&gt;terrible car crash&lt;/a&gt; (note: don’t spend too long reading that 2010 profile until you read a bit more about Reynolds) that left him nearly paralyzed. He made it to a Sloan Fellowship at MIT, and there met Bob Langer, to whom he confided his hopes to start his own company. He certainly came to the right guy there, since Langer starts companies as quickly as most people order lunch. He took on an idea that Langer’s group was exploring (a sort of sponge that spinal nerves could use as a scaffold after injury) and made the case for starting a whole company around it, and thus InVivo Therapeutics was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t detail every twist and turn, but let’s just say that Reynolds left InVivo in the summer of 2013, leaving quite a trail behind him. High-level employees were walking out the door (or threatening to) if they had to continue working with him – Reynolds was almost a caricature of a hard-driving, profane, abusive boss. And he himself was complaining to Langer and everyone who would listen that he wasn’t being properly compensated on just $545k/year, but it appears that he was spending company money on Broadway shows, first-class air travel, and visits to the finest strip joints up and down the East coast (these expenses are currently being litigated). Oh, and he was never in that terrible car crash. He hurt his back unloading a snack-cake delivery truck in 1991. And he was never paralyzed, although he did have complications from back surgery, but that’s not quite as good a story, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reynolds went on to form another company, with the worryingly odd name of PixarBio, but that’s not going so well, either. He and his associates in that venture appear to have left a substantial debris field of false statements, misrepresentations, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowellsun.com/breakingnews/ci_32069843/man-charged-fraud-case-worked-galvins-registry-division&quot;&gt;stock manipulation&lt;/a&gt;, and in April Reynolds himself was arrested on charges of having defrauded 200 investors. He is presumably spending more time in court than in the strip clubs these days, and probably has no one left to send his table-pounding expletive-filled emails to, other than perhaps his own lawyer, which wouldn’t be a good plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And talk of stock manipulation brings me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-182&quot;&gt;this separate story&lt;/a&gt; from Friday. A group of busy, hard-working biotech investors and executives have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp-pr2018-182.pdf&quot;&gt;charged by the SEC&lt;/a&gt; with defrauding investors in pump-and-dump schemes. These involved three penny-stock biopharmas, and the way the schemes worked is the way that they have always worked, the way that some are working right now this very morning, and the way that stock fraud schemes will work until our sun starts exhausting its hydrogen fuel and cooks the Earth. Here’s how that goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Across all three schemes, Honig was the primary strategist, calling upon other Defendants to buy or sell stock, arrange for the issuance of shares, negotiate transactions, or engage in promotional activity. In each scheme, Honig orchestrated his and his associates’ acquisition of a large quantity of the issuer’s stock at steep discounts, either by acquiring a shell and executing a reverse merger or by participating in financings on terms highly unfavorable to the company. In every scheme, Honig, and soiree combination of Stetson, Brauser, O’Rourke, Groussman and Frost, either explicitly or tacitly agreed to buy, hold or sell their shares in coordination with one another, knowing that a pump and dump was in the offing that would allow them all to profit handsomely. Once Honig and his associates had secured substantial ownership of the issuer, they acted as an undisclosed control group, directing the issuer’s management for their benefit, including orchestrating transactions designed to create market interest in the company or to solidify their control.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To profit from their investment, in each scheme, Honig and his associates would arrange and pay for the promotion of the stock, directing their co-defendant Ford, or a similar promoter, to write favorable and materially misleading articles about the company whose stock price they wanted to inflate. In several instances, to magnify the intended boost to volume and price that would follow a promotional article’s release, Honig, Brauser, O’Rourke, Groussman, Melechdavid and ATG engaged in pre-release manipulative trading to generate a misleading picture of market interest in the company’s stock, priming investor interest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to read one of those paid-for stock promotions? Well, they’re still up (for now) on the &lt;em&gt;Seeking Alpha&lt;/em&gt; site, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/1715672-opko-and-its-billionaire-ceo-invested-in-biozone&quot;&gt;have a look&lt;/a&gt;. What you’re reading is fiction, complete fraudulent fiction. Its author is the Ford named in the SEC complaint, and he was paid to write this garbage, for the explicit purposes of pumping up the price of “Biozone” so the shares could be unloaded onto the unwary. The article (for example) would have you believe that the company under discussion had a technology ready to go into clinical testing, when the truth was that all R&amp;amp;D efforts had already been shut down, and nothing was ever going to be tested at all. The article states that its author had not been compensated for writing it, although three days before he’d been offered a pile of below-market-price shares to do just that. And on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this stuff work? Why yes indeed. Biozone’s trading volume went from zero shares traded, its usual daily performance, to a few thousand shares a day, to a few million within days of the promotion. The stock price nearly doubled, and trading stayed up for the next couple of months. Some of that trading was, of course, all the insiders shoveling their own shares (about 15 million of them) into the bonfire, at a rate (and with a lack of disclosure) that is totally illegal. But the buyers for these had been lined up by the promotional drum-beating. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/1736672-biozone-an-in-depth-look-in-light-of-recent-investments&quot;&gt;other articles&lt;/a&gt; about Biozone to be found on &lt;em&gt;Seeking Alpha&lt;/em&gt; from that period, by people not named in the SEC indictment, and you can make of that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these stories I’m writing about today (there are plenty more) show what anyone in this business should be aware of already: there’s a lot of bull out there. You will probably have noticed that the remains of Theranos have just been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/09/05/644844174/theranos-blood-testing-company-accused-of-massive-fraud-says-it-will-dissolve&quot;&gt;sold off for scrap&lt;/a&gt; (no word of any boxes of black turtlenecks in the lot), and that’s just an unusually high-profile example that is different mainly in degree from what happens all the time. There are articles in what should be reputable sources that are completely unreliable – at the high end of the scale because the reporters believed the great story that someone told them, and at the low end because it’s a deliberate fraud from top to bottom. Glowing articles about technologies, companies, and founders should always be subjected to scrutiny, because the incentives to make things look better than they are are very strong. It does not help that there is such a constantly refilling supply of people yearning, sweating and panting, to be parted from their money: the folks in the SEC complaint took in at least $27 million from investors who piled into unknown penny stocks based on some articles by a dude on &lt;em&gt;Seeking Alpha&lt;/em&gt;.

In these tumors, wild-type RAS cooperates with mutant RAS to promote downstream effector activation and cell proliferation and transformation, suggesting that upstream activators of wild-type RAS are important modulators of mutant RAS-driven oncogenesis. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS1 mediates KRAS-driven proliferation, but little is understood about the role of SOS2. We found that RAS family members have a hierarchical requirement for the expression and activity of SOS2 to drive cellular transformation. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SOS2 critically mediated mutant KRAS-driven, but not HRAS-driven, transformation. &lt;i&gt;Sos2&lt;/i&gt; deletion reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent activation of wild-type HRAS and phosphorylation of the kinase AKT in cells expressing mutant RAS isoforms. Assays using pharmacological inhibitors revealed a hierarchical requirement for signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in promoting RAS-driven cellular transformation that mirrored the requirement for SOS2. KRAS-driven transformation required the GEF activity of SOS2 and was restored in &lt;i&gt;Sos2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;–/–&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs by expression of constitutively activated PI3K. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of &lt;i&gt;SOS2&lt;/i&gt; reduced EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and synergized with MEK inhibition to revert the transformed phenotype of human &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; mutant pancreatic and lung tumor cells. These results indicate that SOS2-dependent PI3K signaling mediates mutant KRAS-driven transformation, revealing therapeutic targets in KRAS-driven cancers. Our data also reveal the importance of three-dimensional culture systems in investigating the mediators of mutant KRAS.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/546/eaar8371.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/546/eaar8371?rss=1</originId><title>Oncogenic RAS isoforms show a hierarchical requirement for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS2 to mediate cell transformation</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1536085370244</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;About a third of tumors have activating mutations in &lt;i&gt;HRAS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NRAS&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt;, genes encoding guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the RAS family.

In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SOS2 critically mediated mutant KRAS-driven, but not HRAS-driven, transformation. &lt;i&gt;Sos2&lt;/i&gt; deletion reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent activation of wild-type HRAS and phosphorylation of the kinase AKT in cells expressing mutant RAS isoforms. Assays using pharmacological inhibitors revealed a hierarchical requirement for signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in promoting RAS-driven cellular transformation that mirrored the requirement for SOS2. KRAS-driven transformation required the GEF activity of SOS2 and was restored in &lt;i&gt;Sos2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;–/–&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs by expression of constitutively activated PI3K. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of &lt;i&gt;SOS2&lt;/i&gt; reduced EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and synergized with MEK inhibition to revert the transformed phenotype of human &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; mutant pancreatic and lung tumor cells. These results indicate that SOS2-dependent PI3K signaling mediates mutant KRAS-driven transformation, revealing therapeutic targets in KRAS-driven cancers. Our data also reveal the importance of three-dimensional culture systems in investigating the mediators of mutant KRAS.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author><name>Sheffels, E., Sealover, N.

Studies of neuron-behaviour correlation and causal manipulation have long been used separately to understand the neural basis of perception. Yet these approaches sometimes lead to drastically conflicting conclusions about the functional role of brain areas. Theories that focus only on choice-related neuronal activity cannot reconcile those findings without additional experiments involving large-scale recordings to measure interneuronal correlations. By expanding current theories of neural coding and incorporating results from inactivation experiments, we demonstrate here that it is possible to infer decoding weights of different brain areas at a coarse scale without precise knowledge of the correlation structure. We apply this technique to neural data collected from two different cortical areas in macaque monkeys trained to perform a heading discrimination task. We identify two opposing decoding schemes, each consistent with data depending on the nature of correlated noise. Our theory makes specific testable predictions to distinguish these scenarios experimentally without requiring measurement of the underlying noise correlations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oFfpAXFrZQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Inferring decoding strategies for multiple correlated neural populations</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1537811436753</crawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006371</link><updateCount>1</updateCount><author><name>Kaushik J.

Second, we provide the necessary Python codes to run the model and also easily input large train and test peptide binding benchmark dataset. Third, we provide Snakemake based workflow that allows to run all the model and performance analysis over all the different test alleles at once in parallel over computer and clusters.

Second, we provide the necessary Python codes to run the model and also easily input large train and test peptide binding benchmark dataset. Third, we provide Snakemake based workflow that allows to run all the model and performance analysis over all the different test alleles at once in parallel over computer and clusters. We also provide comparison analysis of the performances of various models. Finally, in order to help attaining to the best possible DL model by a community effort, this work is intended to be a ready to modify base model and workflow for the global Deep Learning community with no domain knowledge in MHC-peptide binding problem and thus provides all the necessary reference code templates and benchmarking data sets for further developments on the presented model architecture.

This task, known as classification, is typically solved using a suite of algorithms that learn a mathematical rule capable of discriminating one group (e.g., cases) from another (e.g., controls). However, discriminatory methods can only identify cancerous samples that resemble those that the algorithm already saw during training. As such, we argue that discriminatory methods are fundamentally ill-suited for the classification of cancer: because the possibility space of cancer is definitively large, the existence of a one-of-a-kind gene expression signature becomes very likely. Instead, we propose using an established surveillance method that detects anomalous samples based on their deviation from a learned normal steady-state structure.

This task, known as classification, is typically solved using a suite of algorithms that learn a mathematical rule capable of discriminating one group (e.g., cases) from another (e.g., controls). However, discriminatory methods can only identify cancerous samples that resemble those that the algorithm already saw during training. As such, we argue that discriminatory methods are fundamentally ill-suited for the classification of cancer: because the possibility space of cancer is definitively large, the existence of a one-of-a-kind gene expression signature becomes very likely. Instead, we propose using an established surveillance method that detects anomalous samples based on their deviation from a learned normal steady-state structure. By transferring this method to transcriptomic data, we can create an anomaly detector for tissue transcriptomes, a &apos;tissue detector&apos;, that is capable of identifying cancer without ever seeing a single cancer example. Using models trained on normal GTEx samples, we show that our &apos;tissue detector&apos; can accurately classify TCGA samples as normal or cancerous and that its performance is further improved by including more normal samples in the training set. We conclude this report by emphasizing the conceptual advantages of anomaly detection and by highlighting future directions for this field of study.</description><author><name>Quinn, T.

However, the widely used &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pyogenes&lt;/i&gt; Cas9 enzyme (SpCas9) requires an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for target recognition, thereby restricting the targetable genomic loci. Here, we report a rationally engineered SpCas9 variant (SpCas9-NG) that can recognize relaxed NG PAMs. The crystal structure revealed that the loss of the base-specific interaction with the third nucleobase is compensated by newly introduced non–base-specific interactions, thereby enabling the NG PAM recognition.

In contrast to other available tools, SqueezeM includes multi-metagenome support allowing the co-assembly of related metagenomes and the retrieval of individual genomes via binning procedures. Squeeze M features several unique characteristics: Co-assembly procedure or co-assembly of unlimited number of metagenomes via merging of individual assembled metagenomes, both with read mapping for estimation of the abundances of genes in each metagenome. It also includes binning and bin checking for retrieving individual genomes. Internal checks for the assembly and binning steps inform about the consistency of contigs and bins, allowing to spot potential chimeras. Metatranscriptomic analysis is done via mapping of cDNA reads against reference metagenomes.

We illustrate the potential of squeezeM by analyzing 32 gut metagenomes in a fully automatic way, allowing to retrieve several millions of genes and several hundreds of genomic bins. One of the motivations in the development of squeezeM was producing a software capable to run in small desktop computers, thus being amenable to all users and all settings. We were also able to co-assemble two of these metagenomes and complete the full analysis in less than one day using a simple laptop computer, illustrating the capacity of SqueezeM to run without high-performance computing infrastructure.

Oscillatory activity robustly correlates with task demands during many cognitive tasks. However, not only are the network mechanisms underlying the generation of these rhythms poorly understood, but it is also still unknown to what extent they may play a functional role, as opposed to being a mere epiphenomenon. Here we study the mechanisms underlying the influence of oscillatory drive on network dynamics related to cognitive processing in simple working memory (WM), and memory recall tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the frequency of oscillatory input interacts with the intrinsic dynamics in networks of recurrently coupled spiking neurons to cause changes of state: the neuronal correlates of the corresponding cognitive process. We find that slow oscillations, in the delta and theta band, are effective in activating network states associated with memory recall. On the other hand, faster oscillations, in the beta range, can serve to clear memory states by resonantly driving transient bouts of spike synchrony which destabilize the activity. We leverage a recently derived set of exact mean-field equations for networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons to systematically study the bifurcation structure in the periodically forced spiking network. Interestingly, we find that the oscillatory signals which are most effective in allowing flexible switching between network states are not smooth, pure sinusoids, but rather burst-like, with a sharp onset. We show that such periodic bursts themselves readily arise spontaneously in networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and that the burst frequency can be tuned via changes in tonic drive. Finally, we show that oscillations in the gamma range can actually stabilize WM states which otherwise would not persist.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bbt9ElVGJQM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Helmut Schmidt</name></author><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Helmut Schmidt, Daniele Avitabile, Ernest Montbrió, Alex Roxin&lt;/p&gt;

In this article, I present KPGminer, a tool that retrieves the constituent genes in KEGG pathways for various organisms and organizes that information suitable for many downstream pathway analysis pipelines.

Next, we designed a crawler to extract necessary information from the response and generated outputs accordingly. KPGminer brings several key features including organism-specific and pathway-specific extraction of pathway genes from KEGG and always up-to-date information. Thus, we hope KPGminer can be a useful and effective tool to make downstream pathway analysis easier and faster.

This article presents the structures, energies and reactivity of the carbon allotropes with four‐membered ring structures as well as the background of the findings in the context of the global exploration of potential energy surfaces. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165b48cd05a:4e43fa:6f86c10b</id><published>1536303600000</published><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/410688v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>We present a nonlinear programming (NLP) framework for the scalable solution of parameter estimation problems that arise in dynamic modeling of biological systems.

to keep an eye on: eleven of the largest national research funding agencies in Europe have announced a plan to require open-access publication of papers arising from their grants. The plan is that by 2020, &lt;em&gt;all such work&lt;/em&gt; must be published in compliant open-access journals or on compliant open-access platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few other provisions as well: authors are to retain copyright without restriction, first off. Standards for that adjective “compliant” will be drawn up and made public for journals and platforms, and in cases where no such entity exists, the agencies will provide incentives and support for their formation. Another key point: “It is acknowledged that all scientists should be able to publish their work Open Access even if their institutions have limited means”, which means that institutions (and not individual researchers) are to pick up the cost, and apparently there will be subsidies available in cases where this isn’t feasible. To that end, open access fees will be standardized and capped across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And publishers take note: the “hybrid” model of publication is explicitly stated not to be compliant. That’s the one where some of the papers in the journal are open access (presumably because the authors paid for them to be) and the rest of them aren’t. The European funding agencies are saying that this isn’t going to cut it: work will be published only in venues that are completely open access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has to be the loudest and highest-caliber shot yet across the bow of the current subscription model in scientific publishing. How will Elsevier, Springer/Nature, Wiley and the others react? How will the scientific societies themselves react? That latter question will emphasize that some of them are, in fact, more publishers than they are scientific societies, at least as how that latter term is popularly perceived. (There are other organizations that are, financially, better thought of as life insurance companies or direct marketing providers than as any sort of membership society, but I don’t know if any of the scientific ones have quite made it to that point or not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, this has potential to really shake things up, and in a pretty short time frame, too. Grab some popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;

However, GWA techniques for detecting epistasis, the interactions between genetic variants associated with phenotypes, are still limited. We believe that developing an efficient and effective GWA method to detect epistasis will be a key for discovering sophisticated pathogenesis, which is especially important for complex diseases such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). In this regard, this study presents GenEpi, a computational package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by the proposed machine learning approach, and illustrates the application of GenEpi on predicting the diagnosis and the progression of AD. Methods: The key concept of GenEpi is a feature extraction process based on gene structures. Since a gene is the minimal physical and functional unit of heredity, GenEpi considers a gene as a unit to retrieve genetic variants as features. GenEpi adopts two-element combinatorial encoding when producing features and constructs the prediction models by randomized regression. Features are first modeled using combinatorial encoding followed by randomized regression to detect the epistasis within a single gene. The selected features for each gene are then pooled together to identify cross-gene epistasis, using randomized regression again. This study uses AD as an example to reveal the capability of GenEpi in finding disease-related variants and variant interactions that show both biological meanings and predictive power. Results: This study compared GenEpi with several commonly used algorithms for detecting epistasis, including FastEpistasis, BOOST and ReliefF. The simulation data demonstrated that GenEpi outperforms the other methods in ranking the true epistasis as the top one. As real data is concerned, the results suggest that the epistasis selected by GenEpi has the best predictive power for two major phenotypes in the AD dataset: diagnosis of AD and disease progression. For diagnosis, the proposed model of predicting AD contains three clinical features (Age, Gender and Education) and 14 genetic features, including 24 SNPs from 12 genes that contain the well-known causal gene, APOE. The 2-fold cross validation (CV) and leave-one-out CV (LOO CV) accuracy of this model are 0.83 and 0.81, respectively. On the other hand, for predicting progression, the proposed model contains eight clinical features (Age, Gender, Education, Cognitively Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Late MCI, AD, and MMSE at baseline) and four genetic features, including seven SNPs from six genes, where all of the four genetic features are cross-gene epistasis with significant p-values (&amp;lt; 10-11). The average of Pearson and Spearman correlation of 2-fold CV and LOO CV are 0.52 and 0.53, respectively. The results on AD demonstrated that GenEpi has the ability to detect the epistasis associated with phenotypes effectively and efficiently. The released package can be generalized to largely facilitate the studies of many complex diseases in the near future. Availability: GenEpi is an open-source python package and available free of charge only for non-commercial users. The package can be downloaded from https://github.com/Chester75321/GenEpi, and has also been published on The Python Package Index.</content></content><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421719v4?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421719v4?rss=1</originId><title>GenEpi: Gene-based Epistasis Discovery Using Machine Learning [NEW RESULTS]</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1538200813554</crawled><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421719v4?rss=1</link><description>Motivation: Genome-wide association (GWA) studies provide a powerful means to identify associations between genetic variants and phenotypes.

Through genomic analysis of multiple data sets, stochastic simulations, and experiments with designed sequences of proteins with identical amino acids but altered codon usage, we showed that changes in tRNA abundance affected protein expression independently of factors such as mRNA abundance. We suggest that cells alter their tRNA abundance to selectively affect the translation rates of specific transcripts to increase the amounts of required proteins under diverse stress conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author><name>Torrent, M., Chalancon, G., de Groot, N.
