Image analysis is a way to automate identification and was previously done at Naturalis Biodiversity Center for slipper orchids (Cypripedioideae) by the program OrchID. This program operated by extracting a pre-defined number of features from images, and these features were used to train artificial neural networks (ANN) to classify out-of-sample images. This program was extended to work for a collection of Javanese butterflies, donated to Naturalis by the Van Groenendael-Krijger Foundation. Originally, for the orchids, an image was divided into a pre-defined number of horizontal and vertical bins and the mean blue-green-red values of each bin were calculated (BGR method) to obtain image features. In the extended implementation, characteristic image features were extracted using the SURF algorithm implemented in OpenCV and clustered with the BagOfWords method (SURF-BOW method). In addition, a combination of BGR- and SURF-BOW was implemented to extract both types of features in a single dataset (BGR-SURF method). A selection of the butterfly and orchid images was made to create datasets with at least 5 and at most 50 specimens per species. The SURF-BOW and BGR-SURF methods were applied to both selected datasets, and the original BGR method was applied to the selected butterfly dataset. PCA plots were made to inspect visually how well the applied methods discriminated among the species. For the butterflies, both genus and species appeared to cluster together in the plots of the SURF-BOW method. However, no obvious clustering was noticeable for the orchid plots. The performance of the ANNs was validated by a stratified k-fold cross-validation. For the butterflies, the BGR-SURF method scored best with an accuracy of 77%, against 71% for the SURF-BOW method and 66% for the BGR method, all for chained genus and species prediction with k = 10. The new methods could not improve the accuracy of the orchid classification with k = 10, which was 75% on genus, 52% on genus and section and 48% on genus, section and species in the original framework and now less than 25% for all. The validation results also showed that at least about 15 specimens per species were necessary for a good prediction with the SURF-BOW method. The BGR-SURF method was found to be the best of these methods for butterflies, but the original BGR method was best for the slipper orchids. In the future these methods may be tested with other datasets, for example with mosquitoes. In addition, other classifiers may be tested for better performance, like support vector machines.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>de Vetter, S.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/408146v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/408146v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1536089377804</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165a60fcc0c:2d568bd:b99eedab</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/408146v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1536044400000</published><fingerprint>8b63c259</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/04/408146</canonicalUrl><description>Taxonomic experts classify millions of specimens, but this is very time-consuming and therefore expensive.

OGs are defined with respect to a chosen taxonomic level, which delimits the position of the LCA in time to a specified speciation event. A hierarchy of OGs expands on this notion, connecting more general OGs, distant in time, to more recent, fine-grained OGs, thereby spanning multiple levels of the tree of life. Large scale inference of OG hierarchies with independently computed taxonomic levels can suffer from inconsistencies between successive levels, such as the position in time of a duplication event. This can be due to confounding genetic signal or algorithmic limitations. Importantly, inconsistencies limit the potential use of OGs for functional annotation and third-party applications. Results: Here we present a new methodology to ensure hierarchical consistency of OGs across taxonomic levels. To resolve an inconsistency, we subsample the protein space of the OG members and perform gene tree-species tree reconciliation for each sampling. Differently from previous approaches, by subsampling the protein space, we avoid the notoriously difficult task of accurately building and reconciling very large phylogenies. We implement the method into a high-throughput pipeline and apply it to the eggNOG database. We use independent protein domain definitions to validate its performance. Conclusion: The presented consistency pipeline shows that, contrary to previous limitations, tree reconciliation can be a useful instrument for the construction of OG hierarchies. The key lies in the combination of sampling smaller trees and aggregating their reconciliations for robustness. Results show comparable or greater performance to previous pipelines.

This increase, in conjunction with the heterogeneity and variability of the data, presents a major challenge to adopt an integrative research approach. We are facing an urgent need to effectively integrate and assimilate complementary datasets to understand the biological system as a whole. The Semantic Web offers technologies for the integration of heterogeneous data and their transformation into explicit knowledge thanks to ontologies. We have developed the Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD - www.agrold.org), a knowledge-based system relying on Semantic Web technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about plant species of high interest for the plant science community e.g., rice, wheat, arabidopsis. We present some integration results of the project, which initially focused on genomics, proteomics and phenomics. AgroLD is now an RDF (Resource Description Format) knowledge base of 100M triples created by annotating and integrating more than 50 datasets coming from 10 data sources -such as Gramene.org and TropGeneDB- with 10 ontologies -such as the Gene Ontology and Plant Trait Ontology. Our evaluation results show users appreciate the multiple query modes which support different use cases. AgroLD&apos;s objective is to offer a domain specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease resistance or high yield traits. We expect the resolution of these questions to facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a knowledge-oriented approach.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Venkatesan, A.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325423v3?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325423v3?rss=1</link><crawled>1537129507353</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165e40eea19:11a910a:3097813d</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325423v3?rss=1</originId><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1537081200000</published><fingerprint>9aa0efba</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/16/325423</canonicalUrl><description>Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have resulted in a tremendous increase in the amount of omics data produced in plant science. This increase, in conjunction with the heterogeneity and variability of the data, presents a major challenge to adopt an integrative research approach. We are facing an urgent need to effectively integrate and assimilate complementary datasets to understand the biological system as a whole. The Semantic Web offers technologies for the integration of heterogeneous data and their transformation into explicit knowledge thanks to ontologies. We have developed the Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD - www.agrold.org), a knowledge-based system relying on Semantic Web technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about plant species of high interest for the plant science community e.g., rice, wheat, arabidopsis. We present some integration results of the project, which initially focused on genomics, proteomics and phenomics. AgroLD is now an RDF (Resource Description Format) knowledge base of 100M triples created by annotating and integrating more than 50 datasets coming from 10 data sources -such as Gramene.org and TropGeneDB- with 10 ontologies -such as the Gene Ontology and Plant Trait Ontology. Our evaluation results show users appreciate the multiple query modes which support different use cases. AgroLD&apos;s objective is to offer a domain specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease resistance or high yield traits. We expect the resolution of these questions to facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a knowledge-oriented approach.</description><engagement>0</engagement><title>Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD): a Knowledge-based System to Enable Integrative Biology in Agronomy [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><content><content>Here we present Parliament2: a structural variant caller which combines multiple best-in-class structural variant callers to create a highly accurate callset.

The capacity to learn abstract concepts such as ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ is considered a higher-order cognitive function, typically thought to be dependent on top-down neocortical processing. It is therefore surprising that honey bees apparantly have this capacity. Here we report a model of the structures of the honey bee brain that can learn sameness and difference, as well as a range of complex and simple associative learning tasks. Our model is constrained by the known connections and properties of the mushroom body, including the protocerebral tract, and provides a good fit to the learning rates and performances of real bees in all tasks, including learning sameness and difference. The model proposes a novel mechanism for learning the abstract concepts of ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ that is compatible with the insect brain, and is not dependent on top-down or executive control processing.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HFdx2Lid-Jk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Abstract concept learning in a simple neural network inspired by the insect brain</title><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/HFdx2Lid-Jk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006435</link><crawled>1537206355747</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165e8a38723:de3c6:3da9d93</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006435</originId><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><author><name>Alex J.

Fluidigm&apos;s C1 Auto Prep system isolates fluorescence-stained cells into specially designed capture sites, generates high-resolution image data and prepares the associated cDNA libraries for mRNA sequencing. Current statistical methods focus on the analysis of the gene expression profiles and ignore the important information carried by the images. Here we propose a new direction for single-cell data analysis and develop CONFESS, a customized cell detection and fluorescence signal estimation model for images coming from the Fluidigm C1 system.

Fluidigm&apos;s C1 Auto Prep system isolates fluorescence-stained cells into specially designed capture sites, generates high-resolution image data and prepares the associated cDNA libraries for mRNA sequencing. Current statistical methods focus on the analysis of the gene expression profiles and ignore the important information carried by the images. Here we propose a new direction for single-cell data analysis and develop CONFESS, a customized cell detection and fluorescence signal estimation model for images coming from the Fluidigm C1 system. Applied to a set of HeLa cells expressing fluorescence cell cycle reporters, the method predicted the progression state of hundreds of samples and enabled us to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of the HeLa cell cycle. The output can be easily integrated with the associated single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles for deeper understanding of a given biological system.

These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space is essential for downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance changes: i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning: when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches - PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE.

These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space is essential for downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance changes: i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning: when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches - PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on empirical performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for scRNA-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.</description><engagement>0</engagement><title>Parameter tuning is a key part of dimensionality reduction via deep variational autoencoders for single cell RNA transcriptomics [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 cleaves its target DNA and is a powerful genome-editing tool.

For some years now, that has been a huge, massive, unstoppable wave in cancer research, and I would not want to try to estimate how much time, effort, and money has gone into it. But it’s been worthwhile, very worthwhile, and the good part is that the story is still going on. Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/advanced-medicineprize2018.pdf&quot;&gt;Nobel scientific summary&lt;/a&gt;, which as always is very well put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been trying to get the immune system enlisted into cancer treatment for at least a hundred years. That involves both figuring out ways to activate an immune response, and understanding how tumors largely manage to evade such a response in the first place. But as anyone who has looked into the field for fifteen seconds can tell you, immunology is one of the most fiendishly complex areas of medicine. It would have to be: left unchecked, a full-blown immune crisis can kill you where you stand, within minutes. That’s one reason why I roll my eyes when I hear ads for “dietary supplements” and the like promising to “activate my immune system”. You want to be really sure about what you’re asking for, because an activated immune system is capable of fearsome amounts of damage if it gets even slightly mis-aimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s all the more reason to try to aim it at tumor cells. This gets to the intricate question of “self and non-self” recognition in immunology, which has been the subject of research for many decades now. The medical implications for better control of this process are immediately clear – to start with, organ transplants (keeping your immune system from attacking foreign tissue) and cancer therapy (making your immune system recognize some defined tissue as foreign) and treatment for autoimmune diseases (persuading your immune system to realize that your own tissues are not, in fact, foreign after all). It’s an intricate process, though – it would have to be. There are multiple, overlapping checks and balances, switches and regulators everywhere you look. We are clearly the descendants of creatures who found it beneficial to have a complex, decentralized immune response. Our ancestors are the ones who managed to balance things better than the ones who were killed off more easily (or made less likely to reproduce) either by insufficient responses to infection or by too-vigorous immune responses when they weren’t needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s Nobel recognizes the discovery of some of these regulatory systems. Allison’s work involved &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTLA-4&quot;&gt;CTLA-4&lt;/a&gt;, a protein found on the surface of T-cells. It was discovered in 1987, and by 1995 it had been worked out that it was a negative regulator of T-cell function. Many labs were working in this area, with the more clinically-oriented ones going after just those sorts of applications mentioned in the previous paragraph. Mutations in CTLA-4 are very strongly associated with autoimmune diseases (a whole list of them), so a lot of work was directed at this area (trying to make the inhibitory pathway more active). But Allison’s lab concentrated on the possibility of cancer therapy – which frankly, was considered by some to be less likely to work. Immune approaches in this area had a history of failure, or at the very least underperforming greatly, along with a sprinkling of interesting, hard-to-replicate individual responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/CTLA4-300x231.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/CTLA4-300x231.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/CTLA4.jpeg 576w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13861&quot; height=&quot;231&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this application, you’d want T-cells that were more active. Allison and co-workers developed an antibody to CTLA-4, blocking the blocker in a very direct approach. Interestingly, the detailed mechanism by which CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activity remains a matter for debate (the standard immunology response of sighing deeply and saying “Well, it’s complicated. . .” works just fine here as well). But absolutely jamming it up on the cell surface with an antibody, you’d figure that would certainly do something. The first crucial experiments were done with mouse xenografts (transplanted tumors) in 1994, and they were &lt;a href=&quot;http://ivri.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Leach_et_al_Science.pdf&quot;&gt;dramatic indeed&lt;/a&gt;. See the data at right – now, xenografts are not endogenous tumors, and mice sure aren’t humans. But still. That’s the sort of thing you want to see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still not easy to get this idea into humans. Kicking out the jams on CTLA-4 was a scary prospect, and there were not-unreasonable worries that you might shrink a patient’s tumors while killing them in an entirely new way via an autoimmune response. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medarex&quot;&gt;Medarex&lt;/a&gt; (then a small company that few knew much about) was interested, though, and development of a humanized antibody began. It was not a smooth and uneventful path to approval. There were indeed autoimmune side effects in human patients, and  there was the usual problem that a broad-spectrum oncology program has: where to start? It can be quite difficult to figure out which tumor types (and which patients) will benefit the most, and really useful therapies can be obscured if you go down the wrong path. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/06/23/medarex_ipilimumab_prostate_cancer_and_reality&quot;&gt;wrote here&lt;/a&gt; about ipilimumab, which is the antibody that came out of this work, which it produced hard-to-interpret results in prostate cancer patients (an area where it still has had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25572782&quot;&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; showing a survival benefit). But that blog post mentions that results were already better in melanoma trials, and that’s where the drug has been approved (as Yervoy). Bristol-Myers Squibb bought Medarex for Yervoy and for the company’s antibody platform, in what &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/05/15/a-look-at-antibody-therapies&quot;&gt;has been called&lt;/a&gt; “one of the best biotech acquisitions of all time”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half of today’s award is PD-1. Honjo’s group discovered this cell-surface protein in the early 1990s while working on dying mouse cells. It was thought to have a role in such cell death pathways (thus the name, from Programmed cell Death), but knocking it out in mice led only to an apparently mild phenotype that seemed to have something to do with the immune system. The animals had enlarged spleens, and developed lupus-like symptoms late in life. Further work (by groups all around the world) helped establish that PD-1 was in the same general family as CTLA-4, and was part of yet another regulatory pathway to keep T cells from going wild. Honjo’s group and collaborators discovered twos endogenous ligand for the receptor, the PD-L1 and PD-L2 proteins, and also found clues that this pathway might be important to tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first report of the use of a PD-1 antibody against tumors came in 2005 from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC129438/&quot;&gt;Honjo’s group&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/65/3/1089&quot;&gt;the group of&lt;/a&gt; Lieping Chen, who had also made fundamental discoveries in this area (and who is a plausible candidate, one of several, for the “How come there aren’t three people on this prize” question). At right is the effect of that antibody on mice who had had susceptible tumor cells introduced, and this is another one of these no-contest graphs that tells you that a hypothesis has been nailed. These papers went into the details of what’s been driving the field ever since: whether or not a given tumor expresses PD-1, and to what degree, and the idea of using antibodies against either the receptor or the ligand protein. Ono Pharmaceuticals in Japan got into the field and partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb (again!) to advance nivolumab (known as Opdivo) into the clinic. It has performed very well, at times spectacularly, and there are plenty of other PD-1 based therapies out there with it by now (Merck’s Keytruda/pembrolizumab being the most famous).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole PD-1 field is too large and too fast-moving to be capable of easy review. It seems that every couple of months there’s another study in another tumor type, or another combination. But I do want to mention the intersection of PD-1 and CTLA-4, because there’s no obvious reason why they might not work at the same time. That is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/06/bristol-myers-squibb-sows-confusion&quot;&gt;beginning to be decided&lt;/a&gt; right now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29355075&quot;&gt;in the clinic&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s too early to say what’s going to happen overall. I have little doubt that there will be a number of situations where that combination will be better than either agent alone, though. Frankly, one of the biggest problems of the whole immuno-oncology area is that there are &lt;em&gt;just too many things to try&lt;/em&gt;, which is quite a situation to be in. The number of I/O clinical trials is arguably already into hold-on-a-minute-here-dudes territory, and there’s an immense amount of dust in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s clear is that this has been a revolution in oncology. For all the false starts, missed endpoints, fights over credit and struggles for market share, let there be no doubt: immuno-oncology has been pulling people out of their graves. Cancer cells being what they are, tumors can eventually turn around and mutate their way past the existing therapies in many cases. But there are people with advanced cancers who had been told to get their affairs in order who are still walking around, watching their children grow up. Many of these combinations of drugs and specific tumor types are too new to even be sure what the overall survival benefits are, other than being (in many cases) very substantial compared to the options that anyone had before. Those curves are still being drawn. One other point: I’ve mentioned some of the companies involved along the way in this post, and it should be emphasized that industrial development of these discoveries has been absolutely crucial in getting them available to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the good part, as I said at the beginning, is that the story is still going on. Today’s prize was widely anticipated, and that’s because it’s so well-deserved. The only regret I have about it – and it’s a regret that shows up every year during Nobel season – is that the prize tends to make discoveries like these seem like the work of far fewer people than they really are. This one has absolutely taken a scientific army, and the campaign continues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/10/01/a-nobel-for-immuno-oncology</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13860</link><crawled>1538402211234</crawled><summary><content>As many had expected, the Nobel prize in medicine/physiology this year recognizes advances in immuno-oncology: James Allison (for CTLA4) and Tasuku Honjo (PD-1).

Our results illustrate the potential of this consensus approach for the automated retrieval of outliers and also the identification of biomarkers associated with survival in large datasets.</description><engagement>0</engagement><title>Consensus outlier detection in survival analysis using the rank product test [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32079-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DaReUS-Loop: accurate loop modeling using fragments from remote or unrelated proteins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DaReUS-Loop: accurate loop modeling using fragments from remote or unrelated proteins, Published online: 12 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32079-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32079-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;DaReUS-Loop: accurate loop modeling using fragments from remote or unrelated proteins&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/xBfxMszcoik&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Yasaman Karami</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/xBfxMszcoik/s41598-018-32079-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32079-w</link><crawled>1536744048224</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_165cd154660:28cc15:6f86c10b</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32079-w</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1536735600000</published><fingerprint>a2c49b79</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DaReUS-Loop: accurate loop modeling using fragments from remote or unrelated proteins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DaReUS-Loop: accurate loop modeling using fragments from remote or unrelated proteins, Published online: 12 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32079-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32079-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;DaReUS-Loop: accurate loop modeling using fragments from remote or unrelated proteins&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/xBfxMszcoik&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-32079-w/MediaObjects/41598_2018_32079_Fig1_HTML.png</url><contentType>image/png</contentType><height>438</height></visual><entities><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>DaReUS - Loop</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/dareus - loop</id><mentions><item><text>Loop</text></item><item><text>DaReUS - Loop</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>JS</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/js</id><mentions><item><text>JS</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>ab</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/ab</id><mentions><item><text>ab</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Protein Data Bank</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Protein Data Bank</id><mentions><item><text>Protein Data Bank</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>CASP12</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/casp12</id><mentions><item><text>CASP12</text></item></mentions></item></entities><title>DaReUS-Loop: accurate loop modeling using fragments from remote or unrelated proteins</title></item><item><title>Palladium–Catalysed Magnesiation of Benzene</title><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Palladium_Catalysed_Magnesiation_of_Benzene/7082987</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Palladium_Catalysed_Magnesiation_of_Benzene/7082987</link><crawled>1536945410315</crawled><summary><content>In the presence of a catalytic quantity of a palladium bis(phosphine) complex, a reagent containing a Mg-Mg bond effects the C-H functionalisation of benzene.

Although many multi-omics analysis methods have been developed for complex disease studies, there is no simulation tool that simulates multiple types of omics data and models their relationships with disease status. Without such a tool, it is difficult to evaluate the multi-omics analysis methods on the same scale and to estimate the sample size or power when planning a new multi-omics disease study. We developed a multi-omics data simulator OmicsSIMLA, which simulates genomics (i.e., SNPs and copy number variations), epigenomics (i.e., whole-genome bisulphite sequencing), transcriptomics (i.e., RNA-seq), and proteomics (i.e., normalized reverse phase protein array) data at the whole-genome level. Furthermore, the relationships between different types of omics data, such as meQTLs (SNPs influencing methylation), eQTLs (SNPs influencing gene expression), and eQTM (methylation influencing gene expression), were modeled. More importantly, the relationships between these multi-omics data and the disease status were modeled as well. We used OmicsSIMLA to simulate a multi-omics dataset for breast cancer under a hypothetical disease model, and used the data to compare the performance among existing multi-omics analysis methods in terms of disease classification accuracy and run time. Our results demonstrated that complex disease mechanisms can be simulated by OmicsSIMLA, and a random forest-based method showed the highest prediction accuracy when the multi-omics data were properly normalized.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Chung, R.-H.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/426510v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/426510v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1537964888910</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16615d9d34e:11ed30:19b4cc1a</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/426510v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1537945200000</published><fingerprint>ae1c7b5c</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/26/426510</canonicalUrl><description>An integrative multi-omics analysis approach that combines multiple types of omics data including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics, has become increasing popular for understanding the pathophysiology of complex diseases.

Yet, there are only few studies that propose algorithms on this particularly important research field. Results: In this study, we first overview the current literature and define two general terms for the types of approaches in general for gene level cell-to-cell communications: Gene Regulatory Cross Networks (GRCN) and Gene Co-Expression Cross Networks (GCCN). We then propose two algorithms for each type, named as GRCNone and GCCNone. We applied them to reveal communications among 8 different immune cell types and evaluate their performances mainly via membrane protein database. Also, we show the biological relevance of the predicted cross-networks with pathway enrichment analysis. We then provide an approach that prioritize the targets by ranking them before experimental validations. Conclusions: We establish two main approaches and propose algorithms for genome-wide scale gene level cell-to-cell communications between any two different cell-types. This study aims accelerating this relatively new avenue of research in cross-networks and points out the gap of it with the well-established single cell type gene networks. The proposed algorithms have the potential to reveal gene level interactions between normal and disease cell types. For instance, they might reveal the interaction of genes between tumor and normal cells, which are the potential drug-targets and thus can help finding new cures that might prevent the prevailing of tumor cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Altay, G.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/415943v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/415943v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1536880624081</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165d53941d1:f6d419:6f86c10b</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/415943v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1536822000000</published><fingerprint>7d7c6d0f</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/13/415943</canonicalUrl><description>Background: Gene level cell-to-cell communications are crucial part of biology as they may be potential targets of drugs and vaccines against a disease condition of interest.

For instance, they might reveal the interaction of genes between tumor and normal cells, which are the potential drug-targets and thus can help finding new cures that might prevent the prevailing of tumor cells.</description><engagement>0</engagement><title>Gene Regulatory Cross Networks: Inferring Gene Level Cell-to-Cell Communications of Immune Cells [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32870-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Involvement of DHH and GLI1 in adrenocortical autograft regeneration in rats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involvement of DHH and GLI1 in adrenocortical autograft regeneration in rats, Published online: 28 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32870-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32870-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Involvement of DHH and GLI1 in adrenocortical autograft regeneration in rats&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/xpqGxv36Ci8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Nae Takizawa</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/xpqGxv36Ci8/s41598-018-32870-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32870-9</link><crawled>1538126543075</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1661f7c78e3:f99e04:a84931b0</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32870-9</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1538118000000</published><fingerprint>20beb901</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Involvement of DHH and GLI1 in adrenocortical autograft regeneration in rats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involvement of DHH and GLI1 in adrenocortical autograft regeneration in rats, Published online: 28 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32870-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32870-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Involvement of DHH and GLI1 in adrenocortical autograft regeneration in rats&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/xpqGxv36Ci8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>457</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-32870-9/MediaObjects/41598_2018_32870_Fig1_HTML.png</url><contentType>image/png</contentType><height>685</height></visual><entities><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>GLI1</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/GLI1</id><mentions><item><text>Gli1</text></item><item><text>GLI1</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>DHH</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/dhh</id><mentions><item><text>DHH</text></item><item><text>Dhh</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>Supplementary Fig</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/supplementary fig</id><mentions><item><text>Supplementary Fig</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>ZF Friedrichshafen</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/ZF Friedrichshafen</id><mentions><item><text>ZF</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>AC</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/ac</id><mentions><item><text>AC</text></item></mentions></item></entities><title>Involvement of DHH and GLI1 in adrenocortical autograft regeneration in rats</title></item><item><updateCount>1</updateCount><canonical><item><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006431</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>2</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kristopher A.

Interactions among microbial community members can lead to emergent properties, such as enhanced productivity, stability, and robustness. Iron-oxide mats in acidic (pH 2–4), high-temperature (&gt; 65 °C) springs of Yellowstone National Park contain relatively simple microbial communities and are well-characterized geochemically. Consequently, these communities are excellent model systems for studying the metabolic activity of individual populations and key microbial interactions. The primary goals of the current study were to integrate data collected &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; calculations across process-scales encompassing enzymatic activity, cellular metabolism, community interactions, and ecosystem biogeochemistry, as well as to predict and quantify the functional limits of autotroph-heterotroph interactions. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data were used to reconstruct carbon and energy metabolisms of an important autotroph (&lt;i&gt;Metallosphaera yellowstonensis&lt;/i&gt;) and heterotroph (&lt;i&gt;Geoarchaeum&lt;/i&gt; sp. OSPB) from the studied Fe(III)-oxide mat communities. Standard and hybrid elementary flux mode and flux balance analyses of metabolic models predicted cellular- and community-level metabolic acclimations to simulated environmental stresses, respectively. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; geochemical analyses, including oxygen depth-profiles, Fe(III)-oxide deposition rates, stable carbon isotopes and mat biomass concentrations, were combined with cellular models to explore autotroph-heterotroph interactions important to community structure-function. Integration of metabolic modeling with &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; measurements, including the relative population abundance of autotrophs to heterotrophs, demonstrated that Fe(III)-oxide mat communities operate at their maximum total community growth rate (i.e. sum of autotroph and heterotroph growth rates), as opposed to net community growth rate (i.e. total community growth rate subtracting autotroph consumed by heterotroph), as predicted from the maximum power principle. Integration of multiscale data with ecological theory provides a basis for predicting autotroph-heterotroph interactions and community-level cellular organization.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9cziYmlDKfI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Multiscale analysis of autotroph-heterotroph interactions in a high-temperature microbial community</title><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9cziYmlDKfI/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006431</link><crawled>1538071896002</crawled><engagementRate>0.29</engagementRate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1661c3a9fc2:107f683:714e904c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006431</originId><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><author><name>Kristopher A.

While they are limited in their ability to capture complex interactions between tumors and their surrounding environment, they are a cornerstone of cancer research and many important findings have been discovered utilizing cell line models. Not all cell lines are appropriate models of primary tumors, however, which may contribute to the difficulty in translating in vitro findings to patients. Previous studies have leveraged public datasets to evaluate cell lines as models of primary tumors, but they have been limited in scope to specific tumor types and typically ignore the presence of tumor infiltrating cells in the primary tumor samples. We present here a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis utilizing approximately 9,000 transcriptomic profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to evaluate cell lines as models of primary tumors across 22 different tumor types. After adjusting for tumor purity in the primary tumor samples, we performed correlation analysis and differential gene expression analysis between the primary tumor samples and cell lines. We found that cell-cycle pathways are consistently upregulated in cell lines, while no pathways are consistently upregulated across the primary tumor samples. In a case study, we compared colorectal cancer cell lines with primary tumor samples across the colorectal subtypes and identified three colorectal cell lines that were derived from fibroblasts rather than tumor epithelial cells. Lastly, we propose a new set of cell lines panel, the TCGA-110, which contains the most representative cell lines from 22 different tumor types as a more comprehensive and informative alternative to the NCI-60 panel. Our analysis of the other tumor types are available in our web app (http://comphealth.ucsf.edu/TCGA110) as a resource to the cancer research community, and we hope it will allow researchers to select more appropriate cell line models and increase the translatability of in vitro findings.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Yu, K.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/422592v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/422592v2?rss=1</link><crawled>1538111712714</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1661e9a2dca:e3ea8e:19b4cc1a</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/422592v2?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1538031600000</published><fingerprint>518b341a</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/27/422592</canonicalUrl><description>Cancer cell lines are commonly used as models for cancer biology. While they are limited in their ability to capture complex interactions between tumors and their surrounding environment, they are a cornerstone of cancer research and many important findings have been discovered utilizing cell line models. Not all cell lines are appropriate models of primary tumors, however, which may contribute to the difficulty in translating in vitro findings to patients. Previous studies have leveraged public datasets to evaluate cell lines as models of primary tumors, but they have been limited in scope to specific tumor types and typically ignore the presence of tumor infiltrating cells in the primary tumor samples. We present here a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis utilizing approximately 9,000 transcriptomic profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to evaluate cell lines as models of primary tumors across 22 different tumor types. After adjusting for tumor purity in the primary tumor samples, we performed correlation analysis and differential gene expression analysis between the primary tumor samples and cell lines. We found that cell-cycle pathways are consistently upregulated in cell lines, while no pathways are consistently upregulated across the primary tumor samples. In a case study, we compared colorectal cancer cell lines with primary tumor samples across the colorectal subtypes and identified three colorectal cell lines that were derived from fibroblasts rather than tumor epithelial cells. Lastly, we propose a new set of cell lines panel, the TCGA-110, which contains the most representative cell lines from 22 different tumor types as a more comprehensive and informative alternative to the NCI-60 panel. Our analysis of the other tumor types are available in our web app (http://comphealth.ucsf.edu/TCGA110) as a resource to the cancer research community, and we hope it will allow researchers to select more appropriate cell line models and increase the translatability of in vitro findings.</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><title>Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of cell lines as models of primary tumor samples across 22 tumor types [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><author><name>Prud&apos;homme, B., Gompel, N.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6408/1202?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6408/1202?rss=1</link><crawled>1537467233489</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_165f83034d1:13ad557:4c71e4fe</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6408/1202?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1537465180000</published><fingerprint>d743520c</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6408/1202.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><keywords><item>Development</item></keywords><title>A bird&apos;s inner stripes</title></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32302-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>2</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamical instability of the electric transport in superconductors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamical instability of the electric transport in superconductors, Published online: 20 September 2018;

In this study, started from a mathematical derivation of the relationship between the mRNA abundance, transcriptional regulatory signals, and mRNA metabolism on a single cell level, we developed a left truncated mixture Gaussian (LTMG) distribution to accurately infer the modality and distribution of individual gene expression profile in a scRNA-seq data, with modeling the dropout and low expressions as left censored data caused by a limited experimental resolution. We validated the LTMG model is with a much better goodness of fitting on an extensive data set, comparing to the statistical models commonly utilized in other scRNA-seq analysis methods. An LTMG based differential gene expression testing method, namely LTMG-DEG, is further developed.

In this study, started from a mathematical derivation of the relationship between the mRNA abundance, transcriptional regulatory signals, and mRNA metabolism on a single cell level, we developed a left truncated mixture Gaussian (LTMG) distribution to accurately infer the modality and distribution of individual gene expression profile in a scRNA-seq data, with modeling the dropout and low expressions as left censored data caused by a limited experimental resolution. We validated the LTMG model is with a much better goodness of fitting on an extensive data set, comparing to the statistical models commonly utilized in other scRNA-seq analysis methods. An LTMG based differential gene expression testing method, namely LTMG-DEG, is further developed. We experimentally validated a higher sensitivity and specificity of the LTMG-DEG comparing other differential gene expression testing methods. In addition, the assumption of the LTMG model, derived from our system biological derivation, is validated on several independent experimental data sets.

For encapsulated bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, asymptomatic carriage is more common and longer in duration than disease, and hence is often a more convenient endpoint for clinical trials of vaccines against these bacteria. However, using a carriage endpoint entails specific challenges. Carriage is almost always measured as prevalence, whereas the vaccine may act by reducing incidence or duration. Thus, to determine sample size requirements, its impact on prevalence must first be estimated. The relationship between incidence and prevalence (or duration and prevalence) is convex, saturating at 100% prevalence. For this reason, the proportional effect of a vaccine on prevalence is typically less than its proportional effect on incidence or duration. This relationship is further complicated in the presence of multiple pathogen strains. In addition, host immunity to carriage accumulates rapidly with frequent exposures in early years of life, creating potentially complex interactions with the vaccine’s effect. We conducted a simulation study to predict the impact of an inactivated whole cell pneumococcal vaccine—believed to reduce carriage duration—on carriage prevalence in different age groups and trial settings. We used an individual-based model of pneumococcal carriage that incorporates relevant immunological processes, both vaccine-induced and naturally acquired. Our simulations showed that for a wide range of vaccine efficacies, sampling time and age at vaccination are important determinants of sample size. There is a window of favorable sampling times during which the required sample size is relatively low, and this window is prolonged with a younger age at vaccination, and in a trial setting with lower transmission intensity. These results illustrate the ability of simulation studies to inform the planning of vaccine trials with carriage endpoints, and the methods we present here can be applied to trials evaluating other pneumococcal vaccine candidates or comparing alternative dosing schedules for the existing conjugate vaccines.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c40RPkVFr3Q&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Use of an individual-based model of pneumococcal carriage for planning a randomized trial of a whole-cell vaccine</title><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/c40RPkVFr3Q/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006333</link><crawled>1538415902955</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16630bbc0eb:ec92e:20735c59</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006333</originId><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><author><name>Francisco Y.

However, GWA techniques for detecting epistasis, the interactions between genetic variants associated with phenotypes, are still limited. We believe that developing an efficient and effective GWA method to detect epistasis will be a key for discovering sophisticated pathogenesis, which is especially important for complex diseases such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). In this regard, this study presents GenEpi, a computational package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by the proposed machine learning approach, and illustrates the application of GenEpi on predicting the diagnosis and the progression of AD. Methods: The key concept of GenEpi is a feature extraction process based on gene structures. Since a gene is the min-imal physical and functional unit of heredity, GenEpi considers a gene as a unit to retrieve genetic variants as features. Features are first modeled using machine learning approach to detect the epistasis within a single gene. The selected features for each gene are then consider together in order to identify cross-gene epistasis. This study uses AD as an example to reveal the capability of GenEpi in finding disease-related variants and variant interactions that show both bio-logical meanings and predictive power. Results: We compared GenEpi with commonly used algorithms for detecting epistasis, including FastEpistasis, BOOST and ReliefF. Our results suggest that the epistasis selected by GenEpi has the best predictive power for two major phenotypes in the AD dataset: diagnosis of AD and disease progression. For diagnosis, the proposed model of predicting AD contains three clinical features (Age, Gender and Education) and 14 genetic features, including 24 SNPs from 12 genes that contain the well-known causal gene, APOE. The 2-fold cross validation (CV) and leave-one-out CV (LOO CV) accuracy of this model are 0.83 and 0.81, respectively. On the other hand, for predicting progression, the proposed model contains eight clinical features (Age, Gender, Education, Cognitively Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Late MCI, AD, and MMSE at baseline) and four genetic features, including seven SNPs from six genes, where all of the four genetic features are cross-gene epistasis with significant p-values (&amp;lt; 10-11). The average of Pearson and Spearman correlation of 2-fold CV and LOO CV are 0.52 and 0.53, respectively. The results on AD demonstrated that GenEpi has the ability to detect the epistasis associated with phenotypes effectively and efficiently. The released package can be generalized to largely facilitate the studies of many complex diseases in the near future. Availability: GenEpi is an open-source python package and available free of charge only for non-commercial users. The package can be downloaded from https://github.com/Chester75321/GenEpi, and has also been published on The Python Package Index.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Chang, Y.-C.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421719v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421719v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1537480212317</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165f8f63f5d:14e5941:4db7ac35</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421719v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1537426800000</published><fingerprint>33538d08</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/20/421719</canonicalUrl><description>Motivation: Genome-wide association (GWA) studies provide a powerful means to identify associations between genetic variants and phenotypes.

Thus, building highly efficient &amp;quot;search engines&amp;quot; for protein databases is a highly desired function in protein bioinformatics. As of August 2018, there are more than 140,000 protein structures in PDB, and this number is still increasing rapidly. Such a big number introduces a big challenge for scanning the whole structure database with high speeds and high sensitivities at the same time. Unfortunately, classic sequence alignment tools and pairwise structure alignment tools are either not sensitive enough to remote homologous proteins (with low sequence identities) or not fast enough for the task. Therefore, specifically designed computational methods are required for quickly scanning structure databases for homologous proteins. Here, we propose a novel ContactLib-DNN method to quickly scan structure databases for homologous proteins. The core idea is to build structure fingerprints for proteins, and to perform alignment-free comparisons with the fingerprints. Specifically, the fingerprints are low-dimensional vectors representing the contact groups within the proteins. Notably, the Cartesian distance between two fingerprint vectors well matches the RMSD between the two corresponding contact groups.

Thus, building highly efficient &amp;quot;search engines&amp;quot; for protein databases is a highly desired function in protein bioinformatics. As of August 2018, there are more than 140,000 protein structures in PDB, and this number is still increasing rapidly. Such a big number introduces a big challenge for scanning the whole structure database with high speeds and high sensitivities at the same time. Unfortunately, classic sequence alignment tools and pairwise structure alignment tools are either not sensitive enough to remote homologous proteins (with low sequence identities) or not fast enough for the task. Therefore, specifically designed computational methods are required for quickly scanning structure databases for homologous proteins. Here, we propose a novel ContactLib-DNN method to quickly scan structure databases for homologous proteins. The core idea is to build structure fingerprints for proteins, and to perform alignment-free comparisons with the fingerprints. Specifically, the fingerprints are low-dimensional vectors representing the contact groups within the proteins. Notably, the Cartesian distance between two fingerprint vectors well matches the RMSD between the two corresponding contact groups. This is done by using RMSD as the domain knowledge to supervise the deep neural network learning. When comparing to existing methods, ContactLib-DNN achieves the highest average AUROC of 0.959. Moreover, the best candidate found by ContactLib-DNN has a probability of 70.0% to be a true positive. This is a significant improvement over 56.2%, the best result produced by existing methods.</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><title>Learning Protein Structural Fingerprints under the Label-Free Supervision of Domain Knowledge [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0188-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clarifying access to data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarifying access to data, Published online: 07 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0188-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0188-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;To facilitate access to and improve the discoverability of the data in our papers, Nature Medicine is making the data availability statement in our papers more prominent and its language more transparent.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/r8fkvjX1Ia8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Clarifying access to data</title><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/r8fkvjX1Ia8/s41591-018-0188-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0188-2</link><crawled>1536334041193</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_165b4a51069:509a1d:6f86c10b</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0188-2</originId><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1536303600000</published><fingerprint>636e9da6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clarifying access to data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarifying access to data, Published online: 07 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0188-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0188-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;To facilitate access to and improve the discoverability of the data in our papers, Nature Medicine is making the data availability statement in our papers more prominent and its language more transparent.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/r8fkvjX1Ia8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><entities><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>Nature Medicine</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Nature Medicine</id><mentions><item><text>Nature Medicine</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>DAS</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/das</id><mentions><item><text>DAS</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Nature Publishing Group</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Nature Publishing Group</id><mentions><item><text>Nature Research</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>EGA</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/ega</id><mentions><item><text>EGA</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</id><mentions><item><text>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</text></item></mentions></item></entities><engagement>4</engagement></item><item><title>Two-dimensional Kagome Lattices Made of Hetero Triangulenes are Dirac Semimetals or Single-Band Semiconductors</title><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Two-dimensional_Kagome_Lattices_Made_of_Hetero_Triangulenes_are_Dirac_Semimetals_or_Single-Band_Semiconductors/7038767</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Two-dimensional_Kagome_Lattices_Made_of_Hetero_Triangulenes_are_Dirac_Semimetals_or_Single-Band_Semiconductors/7038767</link><crawled>1535985281819</crawled><summary><content>In two dimensions, 11 lattice types are mathematically possible, the Kepler nets, but nature offers only few of them in dense crystals.

We describe emerging evidence for dynamic three-dimensional hubs that combine different elements of the classical models.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>1</engagement><keywords><item>Genetics</item></keywords><title>Developmental enhancers and chromosome topology</title></item><item><engagementRate>1.25</engagementRate><engagement>10</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What the Nobels are — and aren’t — doing to encourage diversity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Nobels are — and aren’t — doing to encourage diversity, Published online: 28 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06879-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06879-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The prize-awarding academies are making changes to their secretive nomination processes to tackle bias, but some say the measures don’t go far enough.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Elizabeth Gibney</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06879-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06879-z</link><crawled>1538137226210</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_166201f7be2:1095c43:a84931b0</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06879-z</originId><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1538118000000</published><fingerprint>b88552c8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What the Nobels are — and aren’t — doing to encourage diversity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Nobels are — and aren’t — doing to encourage diversity, Published online: 28 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06879-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06879-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The prize-awarding academies are making changes to their secretive nomination processes to tackle bias, but some say the measures don’t go far enough.</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06879-z/d41586-018-06879-z_16153730.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height></visual><entities><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>Nobel</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/nobel</id><mentions><item><text>Nobel</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>Nobel Prize</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Nobel Prize</id><mentions><item><text>Nobel Prize</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Göran Hansson</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/göran hansson</id><mentions><item><text>Göran Hansson</text></item><item><text>Hansson</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Rice</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/rice</id><mentions><item><text>Rice</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Bohnet</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/bohnet</id><mentions><item><text>Bohnet</text></item></mentions></item></entities><title>What the Nobels are — and aren’t — doing to encourage diversity</title></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Several studies have suggested that arrestin-mediated signaling by GPCRs requires G protein activation; however, in this issue of &lt;i&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/i&gt;, Luttrell &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; documented arrestin-dependent activation of ERK1/2 by a number of GPCRs.

As such, CPD workflows generally include the batch generation of designed decoys (sampling) followed by ranking and filtering stages to select those with optimal metrics (scoring). Due to these factors, the proper analysis of the decoy population is a key element for the effective selection of designs for experimental validation. Here, we present a set of tools for the analysis of protein design ensembles. The tool is oriented towards protein designers with basic coding training aiming to process efficiently their decoy sets as well as for protocol developers interested in benchmarking their new approaches.

As such, CPD workflows generally include the batch generation of designed decoys (sampling) followed by ranking and filtering stages to select those with optimal metrics (scoring). Due to these factors, the proper analysis of the decoy population is a key element for the effective selection of designs for experimental validation. Here, we present a set of tools for the analysis of protein design ensembles. The tool is oriented towards protein designers with basic coding training aiming to process efficiently their decoy sets as well as for protocol developers interested in benchmarking their new approaches.

[NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><content><content>The three-dimensional organization of the genome plays an important role in gene regulation by enabling distal sequence elements to control the expression level of genes hundreds of kilobases away. Hi-C is a powerful genome-wide technique to measure the contact count of pairs of genomic loci needed to study three-dimensional organization. Due to experimental costs high resolution Hi-C datasets are avail- able only for a handful of cell lines. Computational prediction of Hi-C contact counts can offer a scalable and inexpensive approach to examine three-dimensional genome organization across many cellular contexts. Here we present HiC-Reg, a novel approach to predict contact counts from one-dimensional regulatory signals such as epigenetic marks and regulatory protein binding. HiC-Reg exploits the signal from the region spanning two interacting regions and from across multiple cell lines to generalize to new contexts. Using existing feature importance measures and a new matrix factorization based approach, we found CTCF and chromatin marks, especially repressive and elongation marks, as important for predictive performance. Predicted counts from HiC-Reg identify topologically associated domains as well as significant interactions that are enriched for CTCF bi-directional motifs and agree well with interactions identified from complementary long-range interaction assays. Taken together, HiC-Reg provides a powerful framework to generate high-resolution profiles of contact counts that can be used to study individual locus level interactions as well as higher-order organizational units of the genome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Zhang, S.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/406322v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/406322v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1535799419917</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16594c7640d:186d5e7:b99eedab</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/406322v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>False</unread><published>1535785200000</published><fingerprint>c34af597</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/01/406322</canonicalUrl><description>The three-dimensional organization of the genome plays an important role in gene regulation by enabling distal sequence elements to control the expression level of genes hundreds of kilobases away.

The identification of sensitive indicators of disease progression and therapeutic outcome could help the development of effective strategies for treating HD. We assessed mutant huntingtin (mHTT) and neurofilament light (NfL) protein concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood in parallel with clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging in premanifest and manifest HD mutation carriers. Among HD mutation carriers, NfL concentrations in plasma and CSF correlated with all nonbiofluid measures more closely than did CSF mHTT concentration. Longitudinal analysis over 4 to 8 weeks showed that CSF mHTT, CSF NfL, and plasma NfL concentrations were highly stable within individuals. In our cohort, concentration of CSF mHTT accurately distinguished between controls and HD mutation carriers, whereas NfL concentration, in both CSF and plasma, was able to segregate premanifest from manifest HD. In silico modeling indicated that mHTT and NfL concentrations in biofluids might be among the earliest detectable alterations in HD, and sample size prediction suggested that low participant numbers would be needed to incorporate these measures into clinical trials. These findings provide evidence that biofluid concentrations of mHTT and NfL have potential for early and sensitive detection of alterations in HD and could be integrated into both clinical trials and the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Byrne, L.

Longitudinal analysis over 4 to 8 weeks showed that CSF mHTT, CSF NfL, and plasma NfL concentrations were highly stable within individuals. In our cohort, concentration of CSF mHTT accurately distinguished between controls and HD mutation carriers, whereas NfL concentration, in both CSF and plasma, was able to segregate premanifest from manifest HD. In silico modeling indicated that mHTT and NfL concentrations in biofluids might be among the earliest detectable alterations in HD, and sample size prediction suggested that low participant numbers would be needed to incorporate these measures into clinical trials. These findings provide evidence that biofluid concentrations of mHTT and NfL have potential for early and sensitive detection of alterations in HD and could be integrated into both clinical trials and the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>11</engagement><title>[Research Articles] Evaluation of mutant huntingtin and neurofilament proteins as potential markers in Huntingtons disease</title></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mood variations decoded from multi-site intracranial human brain activity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mood variations decoded from multi-site intracranial human brain activity, Published online: 10 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mood state changes are decoded using human neural activity data from electrodes implanted in seven epilepsy patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Omid G Sani</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200</link><crawled>1536592302242</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_165c409d0a2:1716a5e:4c71e4fe</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200</originId><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1536562800000</published><fingerprint>688b5d4e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mood variations decoded from multi-site intracranial human brain activity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mood variations decoded from multi-site intracranial human brain activity, Published online: 10 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mood state changes are decoded using human neural activity data from electrodes implanted in seven epilepsy patients.</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>563</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nbt.4200-F1.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height></visual><entities><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>U</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/u</id><mentions><item><text>U</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Nat</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/nat</id><mentions><item><text>Nat</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>P.</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/p.</id><mentions><item><text>P.</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Neurosci</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/neurosci</id><mentions><item><text>Neurosci</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Calhoon</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/calhoon</id><mentions><item><text>Calhoon</text></item></mentions></item></entities><title>Mood variations decoded from multi-site intracranial human brain activity</title></item><item><title>Carbon Chain Growth by Sequential Reactions of CO and CO2 with a Transition Metal Carbonyl Complex</title><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Carbon_Chain_Growth_by_Sequential_Reactions_of_CO_and_CO2_with_a_Transition_Metal_Carbonyl_Complex/7064474</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Carbon_Chain_Growth_by_Sequential_Reactions_of_CO_and_CO2_with_a_Transition_Metal_Carbonyl_Complex/7064474</link><crawled>1536591390272</crawled><summary><content>The formation of carbon chains by the coupling of COx (X = 1 or 2) units on transition metals is a fundamental step relevant to Fischer-Tropsch catalysis.

Existing motif prediction methods, however, are limited by high false positive rates in TFBSs identification, contributions from non-sequence-specific binding, and complex and indirect binding mechanisms. High throughput next-generation sequencing data provides unprecedented opportunities to overcome these difficulties, as it provides multiple whole-genome scale measurements of TF binding information. Uncovering this information brings new computational and modeling challenges in high-dimensional data mining and heterogeneous data integration. To improve TFBS identification and novel motifs prediction accuracy in the human genome, we developed an advanced computational technique based on deep learning (DL) and high-performance computing, named DESSO. DESSO utilizes deep neural network and binomial distribution to optimize the motif prediction. Our results showed that DESSO outperformed existing tools in predicting distinct motifs from the 690 in vivo ENCODE ChIP-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) datasets for 161 human TFs in 91 cell lines. We also found that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are prevalent among human TFs, and a total of 61 potential tethering binding were identified among the 100 TFs in the K562 cell line. To further expand DESSO&apos;s deep-learning capabilities, we included DNA shape features and found that (i) shape information has a strong predictive power for TF-DNA binding specificity; and (ii) it aided in identification of the shape motifs recognized by human TFs which in turn contributed to the interpretation of TF-DNA binding in the absence of sequence recognition. DESSO and the analyses it enabled will continue to improve our understanding of how gene expression is controlled by TFs and the complexities of DNA binding.

Progressive viral replication and severe thrombocytopenia are key features of SFTSV infection and fatal outcome, whereas the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We revealed arginine deficiency in SFTS cases by performing metabolomics analysis on two independent patient cohorts, suggesting that arginine metabolism by nitric oxide synthase and arginase is a key pathway in SFTSV infection and consequential death. Arginine deficiency was associated with decreased intraplatelet nitric oxide (Plt-NO) concentration, platelet activation, and thrombocytopenia. An expansion of arginase-expressing granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells was observed, which was related to T cell CD3- chain down-regulation and virus clearance disturbance, implicating a role of arginase activity and arginine depletion in the impaired anti-SFTSV T cell function. Moreover, a comprehensive measurement of arginine bioavailability, global arginine bioavailability ratio, was shown to be a good prognostic marker for fatal prediction in early infection. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that arginine administration was correlated with enhanced Plt-NO concentration, suppressed platelet activation, and elevated CD3- chain expression and eventually associated with an accelerated virus clearance and thrombocytopenia recovery. Together, our findings revealed the arginine catabolism pathway–associated regulation of platelet homeostasis and T cell dysregulation after SFTSV infection, which not only provided a functional mechanism underlying SFTS pathogenesis but also offered an alternative therapy choice for SFTS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Li, X.-K., Lu, Q.-B., Chen, W.-W., Xu, W., Liu, R., Zhang, S.-F., Du, J., Li, H., Yao, K., Zhai, D., Zhang, P.-H., Xing, B., Cui, N., Yang, Z.-D., Yuan, C., Zhang, X.-A., Xu, Z., Cao, W.-C., Hu, Z., Liu, W.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/459/eaat4162?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/459/eaat4162?rss=1</link><crawled>1537380378446</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_165f302e74e:c1c539:4c71e4fe</id><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/459/eaat4162?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1537379439000</published><fingerprint>98b6a9b1</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/459/eaat4162.full</canonicalUrl><description>&lt;p&gt;Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) caused by a recently identified bunyavirus, SFTSV, is an emerging infectious disease with extensive geographical distribution and high mortality.

While they are limited in their ability to capture complex interactions between tumors and their surrounding environment, they are a cornerstone of cancer research and many important findings have been discovered utilizing cell line models. Not all cell lines are appropriate models of primary tumors, however, which may contribute to the difficulty in translating in vitro findings to patients. Previous studies have leveraged public datasets to evaluate cell lines as models of primary tumors, but they have been limited in scope to specific tumor types and typically ignore the presence of tumor infiltrating cells in the primary tumor samples. We present here a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis utilizing approximately 9,000 transcriptomic profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to evaluate cell lines as models of primary tumors across 22 different tumor types. After adjusting for tumor purity in the primary tumor samples, we performed correlation analysis and differential gene expression analysis between the primary tumor samples and cell lines. We found that cell-cycle pathways are consistently upregulated in cell lines, while no pathways are consistently upregulated across the primary tumor samples. In a case study, we compared colorectal cancer cell lines with primary tumor samples across the colorectal subtypes and identified three colorectal cell lines that were derived from fibroblasts rather than tumor epithelial cells. Lastly, we propose a new set of cell lines panel, the TCGA-110, which contains the most representative cell lines from 22 different tumor types as a more comprehensive and informative alternative to the NCI-60 panel. Our analysis of the other tumor types are available in our web app (http://comphealth.ucsf.edu/TCGA110) as a resource to the cancer research community, and we hope it will allow researchers to select more appropriate cell line models and increase the translatability of in vitro findings.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Yu, K.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/422592v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/422592v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1537471276428</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165f86de58c:140bf73:4c71e4fe</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/422592v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1537426800000</published><fingerprint>f560961c</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/20/422592</canonicalUrl><description>Cancer cell lines are commonly used as models for cancer biology.

Multiple sequence alignment programs have been proven to be very useful and they have already been evaluated. In this paper we wished to evaluate the added value provided by taking into account structures. We compared the multiple alignments resulting from 24 programs, either based on sequence, structure, or both, to reference alignments deposited in five databases. Reference databases, on their side, can be split in two: more automatic ones, and more manually ones. Scores have been attributed to each program. As a global rule of thumb, five groups of methods emerge, with the lead to two of the structure-based programs. This advantage is increased at low levels of sequence identity among aligned proteins, or for residues in regular secondary structures or buried. Concerning gap management, sequence-based programs place less gaps than structure-based programs. Concerning the databases, the alignments from the manually built databases are the more challenging for the programs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Carpentier, M.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/413369v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/413369v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1536609661685</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165c512b2f5:19c3bef:6f86c10b</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/413369v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1536562800000</published><fingerprint>d7a78666</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/10/413369</canonicalUrl><description>Facing the huge increase of information about proteins, classification has reached the level of a compulsory task, essential for assigning a function to a given sequence, by means of comparison to existing data.

As a global rule of thumb, five groups of methods emerge, with the lead to two of the structure-based programs. This advantage is increased at low levels of sequence identity among aligned proteins, or for residues in regular secondary structures or buried. Concerning gap management, sequence-based programs place less gaps than structure-based programs. Concerning the databases, the alignments from the manually built databases are the more challenging for the programs.</description><engagement>1</engagement><title>Protein Multiple Alignments: Sequence-based vs Structure-based Programs [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00567</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><author><name>Ian Carter-O’Connell, Anke Vermehren-Schmaedick, Haihong Jin, Rory K.

This work reveals how histones are inherited to sister chromatids and identifies a mechanism by which the replication machinery ensures symmetric cell division.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><keywords><item>Cell Biology, Molecular Biology</item></keywords><title>MCM2 promotes symmetric inheritance of modified histones during DNA replication</title></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32123-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A two-step DNA barcoding approach for delimiting moth species: moths of Dongling Mountain (Beijing, China) as a case study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A two-step DNA barcoding approach for delimiting moth species: moths of Dongling Mountain (Beijing, China) as a case study, Published online: 24 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32123-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32123-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A two-step DNA barcoding approach for delimiting moth species: moths of Dongling Mountain (Beijing, China) as a case study&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/E5H8MLAf7DA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Qian Jin</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/E5H8MLAf7DA/s41598-018-32123-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32123-9</link><crawled>1537780502841</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1660adc5139:d5dcf6:3097813d</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32123-9</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1537772400000</published><fingerprint>2a43bb96</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A two-step DNA barcoding approach for delimiting moth species: moths of Dongling Mountain (Beijing, China) as a case study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A two-step DNA barcoding approach for delimiting moth species: moths of Dongling Mountain (Beijing, China) as a case study, Published online: 24 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32123-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-32123-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A two-step DNA barcoding approach for delimiting moth species: moths of Dongling Mountain (Beijing, China) as a case study&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/E5H8MLAf7DA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-32123-9/MediaObjects/41598_2018_32123_Fig1_HTML.png</url><contentType>image/png</contentType><height>363</height></visual><entities><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>China</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/China</id><mentions><item><text>China</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>Dongling Mountain</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/dongling mountain</id><mentions><item><text>Dongling Mountain</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>Beijing</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Beijing</id><mentions><item><text>Beijing</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>Mol</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/mol</id><mentions><item><text>Mol</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Proc</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/proc</id><mentions><item><text>Proc</text></item></mentions></item></entities><title>A two-step DNA barcoding approach for delimiting moth species: moths of Dongling Mountain (Beijing, China) as a case study</title></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05984-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characterization and targeting of malignant stem cells in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndromes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characterization and targeting of malignant stem cells in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndromes, Published online: 12 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05984-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05984-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) arises from mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).

We propose a novel core genome method that selects conserved sequences in the reference genome by comparing its k-mer content to that of publicly available genome assemblies. The conserved-sequence genome is sample set-independent, which enables prospective pathogen monitoring. Based on clinical data sets of 3436 S. aureus, 1523 K. pneumoniae and 348 E. faecium samples, we show that the conserved-sequence genome disambiguates same-patient samples better than a core genome consisting of conserved genes. The conserved-sequence genome confirms outbreak samples with high accuracy: in a set of 2335 S. aureus samples, it correctly identifies 44 out of 45 outbreak samples, whereas the conserved gene method confirms 38 out of 45 outbreak samples.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>van Aggelen, H.

The conserved-sequence genome is sample set-independent, which enables prospective pathogen monitoring. Based on clinical data sets of 3436 S. aureus, 1523 K. pneumoniae and 348 E. faecium samples, we show that the conserved-sequence genome disambiguates same-patient samples better than a core genome consisting of conserved genes. The conserved-sequence genome confirms outbreak samples with high accuracy: in a set of 2335 S. aureus samples, it correctly identifies 44 out of 45 outbreak samples, whereas the conserved gene method confirms 38 out of 45 outbreak samples.</description><engagement>68</engagement><title>A novel core genome approach to enable prospective and dynamic monitoring of infectious outbreaks [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><author><name>Balasubramani, A.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6407/1083-q?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6407/1083-q?rss=1</link><crawled>1536862349927</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_165d4226a67:d8db1f:4db7ac35</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6407/1083-q?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1536860251000</published><fingerprint>26e7c492</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1083.17.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><title>Age matters in allergy</title></item><item><recrawled>1536594999366</recrawled><engagement>5</engagement><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;India’s surprise plan to send people to space by 2022&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s surprise plan to send people to space by 2022, Published online: 05 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06146-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06146-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;But experts say the mission is a huge task and could detract from more useful space programmes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Sanjay Kumar</name></author><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06146-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06146-1</link><crawled>1536107617934</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_165a7261e8e:418b3:3097813d</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06146-1</originId><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1536130800000</published><fingerprint>6ad48dba</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;India’s surprise plan to send people to space by 2022&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s surprise plan to send people to space by 2022, Published online: 05 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06146-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06146-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;But experts say the mission is a huge task and could detract from more useful space programmes.</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06146-1/d41586-018-06146-1_16088142.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height></visual><entities><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>India</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/India</id><mentions><item><text>Indian</text></item><item><text>India</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>Indian Space Research Organisation</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Indian Space Research Organisation</id><mentions><item><text>Indian Space Research Organisation</text></item><item><text>ISRO</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel><label>Narendra Modi</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Narendra Modi</id><mentions><item><text>Narendra Modi</text></item><item><text>Modi</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Kailasavadivoo Sivan</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/kailasavadivoo sivan</id><mentions><item><text>Kailasavadivoo Sivan</text></item><item><text>Sivan</text></item></mentions></item><item><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel><label>Ajey Lele</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/ajey lele</id><mentions><item><text>Lele</text></item><item><text>Ajey Lele</text></item></mentions></item></entities><title>India’s surprise plan to send people to space by 2022</title></item><item><engagementRate>0.03</engagementRate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Chen &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.

This raises the need to explicitly model the resulting uncertainty and take it into account in any downstream analysis, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. Here, we introduce Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a scalable framework for probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells. Our model uses variational inference and stochastic optimization of deep neural networks to approximate the parameters that govern the distribution of expression values of each gene in every cell, using a non-linear mapping between the observations and a low-dimensional latent space. By doing so, scVI pools information between similar cells or genes while taking nuisance factors of variation such as batch effects and limited sensitivity into account. To evaluate scVI, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis to existing methods for distributional modeling and dimensionality reduction, all of which rely on generalized linear models. We first show that scVI scales to over one million cells, whereas competing algorithms can process at most tens of thousands of cells. Next, we show that scVI fits unseen data more closely and can impute missing data more accurately, both indicative of a better generalization capacity. We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks -- including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression -- and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><author><name>Lopez, R.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292037v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292037v2?rss=1</link><crawled>1537767458555</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1660a1546fb:c7115b:3097813d</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292037v2?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><published>1537686000000</published><fingerprint>aeadb550</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/23/292037</canonicalUrl><description>Transcriptome profiles of individual cells reflect true and often unexplored biological diversity, but are also affected by noise of biological and technical nature.

Existing differential analysis tools for RNA sequencing does not effectively accommodate low abundant genes, as commonly observed in lncRNA. We propose a novel and robust statistical method lncDIFF to detect differential expressed (DE) genes without assuming the true density on normalized counts. Results: lncDIFF adopts the generalized linear model with zero-inflated exponential quasi likelihood to estimate group effect on normalized counts, and employs the likelihood ratio test to detect differential expressed genes. The proposed method and tool is suitable for data processed with standard RNA-Seq preprocessing and normalization pipelines. Simulation results illustrate that lncDIFF detects DE genes with more power and lower false discovery rate regardless of the data pattern. The analysis on a head and neck squamous cell carcinomas study also confirms that lncDIFF has better sensitivity in identifying novel lncRNA genes with relatively large fold change and prognostic value.

Results: lncDIFF adopts the generalized linear model with zero-inflated exponential quasi likelihood to estimate group effect on normalized counts, and employs the likelihood ratio test to detect differential expressed genes. The proposed method and tool is suitable for data processed with standard RNA-Seq preprocessing and normalization pipelines. Simulation results illustrate that lncDIFF detects DE genes with more power and lower false discovery rate regardless of the data pattern. The analysis on a head and neck squamous cell carcinomas study also confirms that lncDIFF has better sensitivity in identifying novel lncRNA genes with relatively large fold change and prognostic value. Availability and Implementation: lncDIFF is an R package available at https://github.com/qianli10000/lncDIFF.</description><engagement>0</engagement><title>lncDIFF: a novel distribution-free method for differential expression analysis of long non-coding RNA [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><title>Ni(0)-Catalyzed α-Allylic Alkylation of Regular Ketones with 1,3-Dienes under pH and Redox-neutral Conditions</title><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Ni_0_-Catalyzed_-Allylic_Alkylation_of_Regular_Ketones_with_1_3-Dienes_under_pH_and_Redox-neutral_Conditions/7072646</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Ni_0_-Catalyzed_-Allylic_Alkylation_of_Regular_Ketones_with_1_3-Dienes_under_pH_and_Redox-neutral_Conditions/7072646</link><crawled>1536678087504</crawled><summary><content>We report a

Spliced alignment that consists in aligning a spliced cDNA sequence against an unspliced genomic sequence, constitutes a promising, yet unexplored approach for the identification of splicing orthology relationships. Existing spliced alignment algorithms do not exploit the information on the splicing structure of the input sequences, namely the exon structure of the cDNA sequence and the exon-intron structure of the genomic sequences. Yet, this information is often available for coding DNA sequences (CDS) and gene sequences annotated in databases, and it can help improve the accuracy of the computed spliced alignments. To address this issue, we introduce a new spliced alignment problem and a method called SplicedFamAlign (SFA) for computing the alignment of a spliced CDS against a gene sequence while accounting for the splicing structures of the input sequences, and then the inference of transcript splicing orthology groups in a gene family based on spliced alignments. Results: The experimental results show that SFA outperforms existing spliced alignment methods in terms of accuracy and execution time for CDS-to-gene alignment. We also show that the performance of SFA remains high for various levels of sequence similarity between input sequences, thanks to accounting for the splicing structure of the input sequences. It is important to notice that unlike all current spliced alignment methods that are meant for cDNA-to-genome alignments and can be used for CDS-to-gene alignments, SFA is the first method specifically designed for CDS-to-gene alignments. We show its usefulness for the comparison of genes and transcripts within a gene family for the purpose of analyzing splicing orthologies. It can also be used for gene structure annotation and alternative splicing analyses. Availability: SplicedFamAlign was implemented in Python.

Submission of genomic data to NCBI GenBank is a requirement prior to publication and plays a critical role in making scientific data publicly available. GenBank currently has automatic prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome annotation pipelines but has no viral annotation pipeline beyond influenza virus. Annotation and submission of viral genome sequence is a non-trivial task, especially for groups that do not routinely interact with GenBank for data submissions. Results: We present Viral Annotation Pipeline and iDentification (VAPiD), a portable and lightweight command-line tool for annotation and GenBank deposition of viral genomes. VAPiD supports annotation of nearly all unsegmented viral genomes. The pipeline has been validated on human immunodeficiency virus, human parainfluenza virus 1-4, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses (229E/OC43/NL63/HKU1/SARS/MERS), human enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, Hepatitis A-E Virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, as well the human polyomaviruses BK/JC/MCV, human adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses. The program can handle individual or batch submissions of different viruses to GenBank and correctly annotates multiple viruses, including those that contain ribosomal slippage or RNA editing without prior knowledge of the virus to be annotated. VAPiD is programmed in Python and is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS systems. Conclusions: We have created a portable, lightweight, user-friendly, internet-enabled, open-source, command-line genome annotation and submission package to facilitate virus genome submissions to NCBI GenBank.

Further, the Cd2+ analogue CdIF-13 is reported here for the first time, and shown to display adsorption behavior distinct from both ZIF-7 and ZIF-9, with negligible pre-step adsorption, a ~50% increase in CO2 and CH4 capacity, and dramatically higher threshold adsorption pressures.

Models describing the process of stem-cell differentiation are plentiful, and may offer insights into the underlying mechanisms and experimentally observed behaviour. Waddington’s epigenetic landscape has been providing a conceptual framework for differentiation processes since its inception. It also allows, however, for detailed mathematical and quantitative analyses, as the landscape can, at least in principle, be related to mathematical models of dynamical systems. Here we focus on a set of dynamical systems features that are intimately linked to cell differentiation, by considering exemplar dynamical models that capture important aspects of stem cell differentiation dynamics. These models allow us to map the paths that cells take through gene expression space as they move from one fate to another, e.g. from a stem-cell to a more specialized cell type. Our analysis highlights the role of the transition state (TS) that separates distinct cell fates, and how the nature of the TS changes as the underlying landscape changes—change that can be induced by e.g. cellular signaling. We demonstrate that models for stem cell differentiation may be interpreted in terms of either a static or transitory landscape. For the static case the TS represents a particular transcriptional profile that all cells approach during differentiation. Alternatively, the TS may refer to the commonly observed period of heterogeneity as cells undergo stochastic transitions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/US819jwYZK0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Transition state characteristics during cell differentiation</title><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/US819jwYZK0/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006405</link><crawled>1537465885092</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165f81ba1a4:5a3a82:215b6325</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006405</originId><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><author><name>Rowan D.

Co-expression network analysis provides useful information for studying gene regulation in biological processes. Examining condition-specific patterns of co-expression can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes activated in a particular condition. One challenge in this type of analysis is that the sample sizes in each condition are usually small, making the statistical inference of co-expression patterns highly underpowered. A joint network construction that borrows information from related structures across conditions has the potential to improve the power of the analysis. One possible approach to constructing the co-expression network is to use the Gaussian graphical model. Though several methods are available for joint estimation of multiple graphical models, they do not fully account for the heterogeneity between samples and between co-expression patterns introduced by condition specificity. Here we develop the condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL), a data-driven approach to incorporate condition specificity in the estimation of co-expression networks. We show that this method improves the accuracy with which networks are learned. The application of this method on a rat multi-tissue dataset and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset provides interesting biological insights. In both analyses, we identify numerous modules enriched for Gene Ontology functions and observe that the modules that are upregulated in a particular condition are often involved in condition-specific activities. Interestingly, we observe that the genes strongly associated with survival time in the TCGA dataset are less likely to be network hubs, suggesting that genes associated with cancer progression are likely to govern specific functions or execute final biological functions in pathways, rather than regulating a large number of biological processes. Additionally, we observed that the tumor-specific hub genes tend to have few shared edges with normal tissue, revealing tumor-specific regulatory mechanism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sYsvXJw3a1s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><title>Condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso (CFGL): An adaptive procedure for inferring condition-specific gene co-expression network</title><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sYsvXJw3a1s/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006436</link><crawled>1537552341756</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165fd42dafc:cf94d:3da9d93</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006436</originId><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><author><name>Yafei Lyu</name></author><published>1537563600000</published><fingerprint>35e8735c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yafei Lyu, Lingzhou Xue, Feipeng Zhang, Hillary Koch, Laura Saba, Katerina Kechris, Qunhua Li&lt;/p&gt;

Dysregulated in a wide spectrum of cancers, in mammals, this pathway is regulated by two key effectors, YAP and TAZ, that may functionally overlap. We found that TAZ promoted liver inflammation and tumor development. The expression of TAZ, but not YAP, in human liver tumors positively correlated with the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Hyperactivated TAZ induced substantial myeloid cell infiltration into the liver and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines through a TEAD-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, tumors with hyperactivated YAP and TAZ had distinct transcriptional signatures, which included the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in TAZ-driven tumors.

Dysregulated in a wide spectrum of cancers, in mammals, this pathway is regulated by two key effectors, YAP and TAZ, that may functionally overlap. We found that TAZ promoted liver inflammation and tumor development. The expression of TAZ, but not YAP, in human liver tumors positively correlated with the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Hyperactivated TAZ induced substantial myeloid cell infiltration into the liver and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines through a TEAD-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, tumors with hyperactivated YAP and TAZ had distinct transcriptional signatures, which included the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines in TAZ-driven tumors. Our study elucidated a previously uncharacterized link between TAZ activity and inflammatory responses that influence tumor development in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><title>The Hippo pathway effector TAZ induces TEAD-dependent liver inflammation and tumors</title></item><item><author><name>Matilde de las Rivas, Earnest James Paul Daniel, Helena Coelho, Erandi Lira-Navarrete, Lluis Raich, Ismael Compañón, Ana Diniz, Laura Lagartera, Jesús Jiménez-Barbero, Henrik Clausen, Carme Rovira, Filipa Marcelo, Francisco Corzana, Thomas A.

The plan is that by 2020, &lt;em&gt;all such work&lt;/em&gt; must be published in compliant open-access journals or on compliant open-access platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few other provisions as well: authors are to retain copyright without restriction, first off. Standards for that adjective “compliant” will be drawn up and made public for journals and platforms, and in cases where no such entity exists, the agencies will provide incentives and support for their formation. Another key point: “It is acknowledged that all scientists should be able to publish their work Open Access even if their institutions have limited means”, which means that institutions (and not individual researchers) are to pick up the cost, and apparently there will be subsidies available in cases where this isn’t feasible. To that end, open access fees will be standardized and capped across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And publishers take note: the “hybrid” model of publication is explicitly stated not to be compliant. That’s the one where some of the papers in the journal are open access (presumably because the authors paid for them to be) and the rest of them aren’t. The European funding agencies are saying that this isn’t going to cut it: work will be published only in venues that are completely open access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has to be the loudest and highest-caliber shot yet across the bow of the current subscription model in scientific publishing. How will Elsevier, Springer/Nature, Wiley and the others react? How will the scientific societies themselves react? That latter question will emphasize that some of them are, in fact, more publishers than they are scientific societies, at least as how that latter term is popularly perceived. (There are other organizations that are, financially, better thought of as life insurance companies or direct marketing providers than as any sort of membership society, but I don’t know if any of the scientific ones have quite made it to that point or not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, this has potential to really shake things up, and in a pretty short time frame, too. Grab some popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;
