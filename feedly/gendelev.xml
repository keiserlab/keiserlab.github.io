While enzymes are often cited as the inspiration for such catalysts, enzymes can also serve as hosts for non-native catalytic components. Protein-based hosts can be readily produced in E. coli and rapidly evolved for particular applications. Moreover, inherent properties of these systems, including their conformational dynamics, can be exploited for non-native transformations that occur within their interior. Studies on the peptidase activity of a prolyl oligopeptidase from Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu POP) suggest that its unique two-domain architecture regulates substrate access and specificity. We have established that Pfu POP also serves as an efficient host for asymmetric cyclopropanation upon active-site modification with a dirhodium cofactor. To understand how Pfu POP controls both peptidase and dirhodium catalysis, we determined the crystal structures of this enzyme and its S477C mutant and used these structures as starting points for MD simulations of both the apo structures and systems containing a covalently linked peptidase inhibitor or a dirhodium catalyst. Pfu POP was crystalized in an open conformation, and MD simulations reveal spontaneous transitions between open and closed states, in addition to a number of smaller scale conformational changes, suggesting facile inter-domain movement. Importantly, key aspects of previously reported peptidase kinetics and cyclopropanation selectivity can be rationalized in the context of this inter-domain opening and closing. This finding constitutes a remarkable example in which the conformational dynamics of a supramolecular host affect two different catalytic activities and suggests that Pfu POP could serve as a host for a wide range of non-native catalysts.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Supramolecular catalysis involves the design and characterization of synthetic macromolecules that catalyze chemical reactions.

We propose to use effective and expressed nucleotide variations (eeSNVs) from scRNA-seq as alternative features for tumor subpopulation identification. We developed a linear modeling framework, SSrGE, to link eeSNVs associated with gene expression. In all the datasets tested, eeSNVs achieve better accuracies than gene expression for identifying subpopulations. Previously validated cancer-relevant genes are also highly ranked, confirming the significance of the method. Moreover, SSrGE is capable of analyzing coupled DNA-seq and RNA-seq data from the same single cells, demonstrating its value in integrating multi-omics single cell techniques.

We propose to use effective and expressed nucleotide variations (eeSNVs) from scRNA-seq as alternative features for tumor subpopulation identification. We developed a linear modeling framework, SSrGE, to link eeSNVs associated with gene expression. In all the datasets tested, eeSNVs achieve better accuracies than gene expression for identifying subpopulations. Previously validated cancer-relevant genes are also highly ranked, confirming the significance of the method. Moreover, SSrGE is capable of analyzing coupled DNA-seq and RNA-seq data from the same single cells, demonstrating its value in integrating multi-omics single cell techniques. In summary, SNV features from scRNA-seq data have merits for both subpopulation identification and linkage of genotype-phenotype relationship.

However, GWA techniques for detecting epistasis, the interactions between genetic variants associated with phenotypes, are still limited. We believe that developing an efficient and effective GWA method to detect epistasis will be a key for discovering sophisticated pathogenesis, which is especially important for complex diseases such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). In this regard, this study presents GenEpi, a computational package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by the proposed machine learning approach, and illustrates the application of GenEpi on predicting the diagnosis and the progression of AD. Methods: The key concept of GenEpi is a feature extraction process based on gene structures. Since a gene is the min-imal physical and functional unit of heredity, GenEpi considers a gene as a unit to retrieve genetic variants as features. Features are first modeled using machine learning approach to detect the epistasis within a single gene. The selected features for each gene are then consider together in order to identify cross-gene epistasis. This study uses AD as an example to reveal the capability of GenEpi in finding disease-related variants and variant interactions that show both bio-logical meanings and predictive power. Results: We compared GenEpi with commonly used algorithms for detecting epistasis, including FastEpistasis, BOOST and ReliefF. Our results suggest that the epistasis selected by GenEpi has the best predictive power for two major phenotypes in the AD dataset: diagnosis of AD and disease progression. For diagnosis, the proposed model of predicting AD contains three clinical features (Age, Gender and Education) and 14 genetic features, including 24 SNPs from 12 genes that contain the well-known causal gene, APOE. The 2-fold cross validation (CV) and leave-one-out CV (LOO CV) accuracy of this model are 0.83 and 0.81, respectively. On the other hand, for predicting progression, the proposed model contains eight clinical features (Age, Gender, Education, Cognitively Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Late MCI, AD, and MMSE at baseline) and four genetic features, including seven SNPs from six genes, where all of the four genetic features are cross-gene epistasis with significant p-values (&amp;lt; 10-11). The average of Pearson and Spearman correlation of 2-fold CV and LOO CV are 0.52 and 0.53, respectively. The results on AD demonstrated that GenEpi has the ability to detect the epistasis associated with phenotypes effectively and efficiently. The released package can be generalized to largely facilitate the studies of many complex diseases in the near future. Availability: GenEpi is an open-source python package and available free of charge only for non-commercial users. The package can be downloaded from https://github.com/Chester75321/GenEpi, and has also been published on The Python Package Index.</content></content><title>GenEpi: Gene-based Epistasis Discovery Using Machine Learning [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421719v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><author><name>Chang, Y.-C.</name></author><published>1537426800000</published><fingerprint>33538d08</fingerprint><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/421719v1?rss=1</link><description>Motivation: Genome-wide association (GWA) studies provide a powerful means to identify associations between genetic variants and phenotypes.

The spikes on virus surfaces bind receptors on host cells to propagate infection. High spike densities (SDs) can promote infection, but spikes are also targets of antibody-mediated immune responses. Thus, diverse evolutionary pressures can influence virus SDs. HIV’s SD is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of other viruses, a surprising feature of unknown origin. By modeling antibody evolution through affinity maturation, we find that an intermediate SD maximizes the affinity of generated antibodies. We argue that this leads most viruses to evolve high SDs. T helper cells, which are depleted during early HIV infection, play a key role in antibody evolution. We find that T helper cell depletion results in high affinity antibodies when SD is high, but not if SD is low. This special feature of HIV infection may have led to the evolution of a low SD to avoid potent immune responses early in infection.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dcSOF7zmBHg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>The low spike density of HIV may have evolved because of the effects of T helper cell depletion on affinity maturation</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/dcSOF7zmBHg/article</href></item></alternate><engagement>4</engagement><unread>True</unread><author><name>Assaf Amitai</name></author><recrawled>1535652733863</recrawled><published>1535662800000</published><fingerprint>17061cba</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006408</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Assaf Amitai, Arup K.

We addressed this issue by upgrading our population genetics tool POPSICLE for aneuploid genomes and studied the population structure of 50 strains of Leishmania to understand genetic diversity and the sexual strategies that predispose to that diversity. Leishmania showed enormous diversity but a dichotomic nature of extreme zygosities. To understand this dichotomy, we specifically studied two species, L. tropica that contained strains with both hetero and homozygosities and L. major that were mainly homozygous. The homozygosity in L. tropica was a consequence of extreme inbreeding while heterozygosity was due to recent hybridizations involving two different genotypes. In contrast, L. major also contained two different genotypes and products of extreme inbreeding but no recent hybridizations. The heterozygous strains of L. tropica that were geographically isolated from the homozygous strains were F1 hybrids that appeared sterile to each other while those in proximity to the homozygous strains were outcrosses involving multiple cycles of hybridization indicating their mating preference with homozygous strains.

Here we propose deep learning (in the form of a convolutional neural network (CNN)) to classify ants at species level using AntWeb images. We used an Inception-ResNet-V2-based CNN to classify ant images, and three shot types with 10,204 images for 97 species, in addition to a multi-view approach, for training and testing the CNN while also testing a worker-only set and an AntWeb protocol-deviant test set. Top 1 accuracy reached 62% - 81%, top 3 accuracy 80% - 92%, and genus accuracy 79% - 95% on species classification for different shot type approaches. The head shot type outperformed other shot type approaches. Genus accuracy was broadly similar to top 3 accuracy. Removing reproductives from the test data improved accuracy only slightly. Accuracy on AntWeb protocol-deviant data was very low. In addition, we make recommendations for future work concerning image threshold, distribution, and quality, multi-view approaches, metadata, and on protocols; potentially leading to higher accuracy with less computational effort.</content></content><title>Taxonomic Classification of Ants (Formicidae) from Images using Deep Learning [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407452v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>1</engagement><unread>True</unread><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Boer, M.

The head shot type outperformed other shot type approaches. Genus accuracy was broadly similar to top 3 accuracy. Removing reproductives from the test data improved accuracy only slightly. Accuracy on AntWeb protocol-deviant data was very low. In addition, we make recommendations for future work concerning image threshold, distribution, and quality, multi-view approaches, metadata, and on protocols; potentially leading to higher accuracy with less computational effort.</description><crawled>1536055181809</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407452v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/04/407452</canonicalUrl></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1660bcf038f:f11397:6f86c10b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: EZH2 inhibition sensitizes &lt;i&gt;BRG1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; mutant lung tumours to TopoII inhibitors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: EZH2 inhibition sensitizes &amp;lt;i&gt;BRG1&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;EGFR&amp;lt;/i&gt; mutant lung tumours to TopoII inhibitors, Published online: 24 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0580-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0580-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: EZH2 inhibition sensitizes &lt;i&gt;BRG1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; mutant lung tumours to TopoII inhibitors</content></content><title>Author Correction: EZH2 inhibition sensitizes BRG1 and EGFR mutant lung tumours to TopoII inhibitors</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0580-6</href></item></alternate><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><entities><item><label>EZH2</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/EZH2</id><mentions><item><text>EZH2</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Epidermal growth factor receptor</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Epidermal growth factor receptor</id><mentions><item><text>EGFR</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>sensitizes BRG1</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/sensitizes brg1</id><mentions><item><text>sensitizes BRG1</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Cascading Style Sheets</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Cascading Style Sheets</id><mentions><item><text>CSS</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Explorer</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/explorer</id><mentions><item><text>Explorer</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Christine M.

The MoMo web server offers more proteome databases, more input formats, larger inputs and longer running times than the motif-x web server.

Proteins with low-complexity domains continue to emerge as key players in both normal and pathological cellular processes. Although low-complexity domains are often grouped into a single class, individual low-complexity domains can differ substantially with respect to amino acid composition. These differences may strongly influence the physical properties, cellular regulation, and molecular functions of low-complexity domains. Therefore, we developed a bioinformatic approach to explore relationships between amino acid composition, protein metabolism, and protein function. We find that local compositional enrichment within protein sequences is associated with differences in translation efficiency, abundance, half-life, protein-protein interaction promiscuity, subcellular localization, and molecular functions of proteins on a proteome-wide scale. However, local enrichment of related amino acids is sometimes associated with opposite effects on protein regulation and function, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between different types of low-complexity domains. Furthermore, many of these effects are discernible at amino acid compositions below those required for classification as low-complexity or statistically-biased by traditional methods and in the absence of homopolymeric amino acid repeats, indicating that thresholds employed by classical methods may not reflect biologically relevant criteria. Application of our analyses to composition-driven processes, such as the formation of membraneless organelles, reveals distinct composition profiles even for closely related organelles. Collectively, these results provide a unique perspective and detailed insights into relationships between amino acid composition, protein metabolism, and protein functions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x3TzhcTkcXI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Proteome-scale relationships between local amino acid composition and protein fates and functions</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/x3TzhcTkcXI/article</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><author><name>Sean M.

Subsequent users of an optimized procedure need only download an electronic file, comparable to a smartphone application, to implement the protocol on their own apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;</description><crawled>1537467233489</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6408/1220?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6408/1220.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_1660c24cdd7:f98931:6f86c10b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A universal SNP and small-indel variant caller using deep neural networks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A universal SNP and small-indel variant caller using deep neural networks, Published online: 24 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4235&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4235&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;DeepVariant uses convolutional neural networks to improve the accuracy of variant calling.</content></content><title>A universal SNP and small-indel variant caller using deep neural networks</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4235</href></item></alternate><engagement>2</engagement><unread>True</unread><entities><item><label>Scottish National Party</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Scottish National Party</id><mentions><item><text>SNP</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>National Geographic Society</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/National Geographic Society</id><mentions><item><text>NGS</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>CNN</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/CNN</id><mentions><item><text>CNN</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>DeepVariant</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/deepvariant</id><mentions><item><text>DeepVariant</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Single-nucleotide polymorphism</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Single-nucleotide polymorphism</id><mentions><item><text>SNPs</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/m685/nature-assets/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/images/nbt.4235-F1.jpg</url><height>455</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><engagementRate>2.0</engagementRate><author><name>Ryan Poplin</name></author><published>1537772400000</published><fingerprint>593100ed</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4235</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A universal SNP and small-indel variant caller using deep neural networks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A universal SNP and small-indel variant caller using deep neural networks, Published online: 24 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4235&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4235&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;DeepVariant uses convolutional neural networks to improve the accuracy of variant calling.</description><crawled>1537802030551</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4235</originId><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_165f1294ab9:90b201:4c71e4fe</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sounding-rocket microgravity experiments on alumina dust&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounding-rocket microgravity experiments on alumina dust, Published online: 19 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06359-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06359-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Alumina is thought to be the main condensate to form in the gas outflow from oxygen-rich evolved stars.

Cooperation is key for the evolution of biological systems ranging from bacteria communities to human societies. Evolutionary processes can dramatically alter the cooperation level. Evolutionary processes are typically of two classes: comparison based and self-evaluation based. The fate of cooperation is extremely sensitive to the details of comparison based processes. For self-evaluation processes, however, it is still unclear whether the sensitivity remains. We concentrate on a class of self-evaluation processes based on aspiration, where all the individuals adjust behaviors based on their own aspirations. We prove that the evolutionary outcome with heterogeneous aspirations is the same as that of the homogeneous one for regular networks under weak selection limit. Simulation results further suggest that it is also valid for general networks across various distributions of personalised aspirations. Our result clearly indicates that self-evaluation processes are robust in contrast with comparison based rules. In addition, our result greatly simplifies the calculation of the aspiration dynamics, which is computationally expensive.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AtRjHXVAAl8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Individualised aspiration dynamics: Calculation by proofs</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AtRjHXVAAl8/article</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><author><name>Bin Wu</name></author><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1537909200000</published><fingerprint>c1cefa57</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006035</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bin Wu, Lei Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, our result greatly simplifies the calculation of the aspiration dynamics, which is computationally expensive.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AtRjHXVAAl8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1537898608254</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006035</originId><updated>1537909200000</updated><recrawled>1537899488524</recrawled><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006035</href></item></canonical></item><item><id>bE0mPve90xtDW7Mgx9+xm/gIKXt54qktoOvefuUy0ZI=_1657b4d7782:1ec3790:d987d511</id><published>1535342400000</published><title>[ASAP] Node-Weighted Amino Acid Network Strategy for Characterization and Identification of Protein Functional Residues</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jcisd8/~3/nqVF5KIH4ZA/acs.jcim.8b00146</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/2018/jcisd8.2018.58.issue-9/acs.jcim.8b00146/20180918/images/medium/ci-2018-001467_0006.gif</url><height>253</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><author><name>Wenying Yan, Guang Hu, Zhongjie Liang, Jianhong Zhou, Yang Yang, Jiajia Chen, Bairong Shen</name></author><fingerprint>4c793d03</fingerprint><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00146</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.8b00146/20180824/images/medium/ci-2018-001467_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00146&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Isolation profoundly influences social behavior in all animals. In humans, isolation has serious effects on health. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful model to study small-scale, temporally-transient social behavior. However, longer-term analysis of large groups of flies is hampered by the lack of effective and reliable tools. We built a new imaging arena and improved the existing tracking algorithm to reliably follow a large number of flies simultaneously. Next, based on the automatic classification of touch and graph-based social network analysis, we designed an algorithm to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation. We observed that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. We explored the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and found that whereas behavior changed throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occurred largely on day one. These changes occurred mostly in metabolic genes, and we verified the metabolic changes by showing an increase of lipid content in isolated flies. In summary, we describe a highly reliable tracking and analysis pipeline for large groups of flies that we use to unravel the behavioral, molecular and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ng-D0RyUL7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>A simple computer vision pipeline reveals the effects of isolation on social interaction dynamics in &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Ng-D0RyUL7g/article</href></item></alternate><engagement>7</engagement><unread>True</unread><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006410.g001</url><height>141</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><width>320</width></visual><author><name>Guangda Liu</name></author><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1535662800000</published><fingerprint>e7a8e703</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006410</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guangda Liu, Tanmay Nath, Gerit A.

Here, the authors investigate a variety of structural features that form upon bending atomically thin 2D-crystals, and predict distinct classes of post deformation microstructure based on their atomic arrangement, bend angle and flake thickness.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/nEgpyPB-5XA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1536140352712</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06074-8</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06074-8</href></item></canonical></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1659fc74276:24f065e:4c71e4fe</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The landmark lectures of physicist Erwin Schrödinger helped to change attitudes in biology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landmark lectures of physicist Erwin Schrödinger helped to change attitudes in biology, Published online: 03 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06166-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06166-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Influence of his book ‘What is Life?’ celebrated and discussed 75 years on.</content></content><title>The landmark lectures of physicist Erwin Schrödinger helped to change attitudes in biology</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06166-x</href></item></alternate><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds><engagement>6</engagement><unread>True</unread><entities><item><label>Erwin Schrödinger</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Erwin Schrödinger</id><mentions><item><text>Erwin Schrödinger</text></item></mentions></item><item><label>Schrödinger</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/schrödinger</id><mentions><item><text>Schrödinger</text></item></mentions></item></entities><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06166-x/d41586-018-06166-x_16092450.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1535958000000</published><fingerprint>771b2fa0</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06166-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The landmark lectures of physicist Erwin Schrödinger helped to change attitudes in biology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landmark lectures of physicist Erwin Schrödinger helped to change attitudes in biology, Published online: 03 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06166-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06166-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Influence of his book ‘What is Life?’ celebrated and discussed 75 years on.</description><crawled>1535983960694</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06166-x</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16616dc4370:2b9de1:a84931b0</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clear up this stem-cell mess&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear up this stem-cell mess, Published online: 26 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06756-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06756-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Confusion about mesenchymal stem cells is making it easier for people to sell unproven treatments, warn Douglas Sipp, Pamela G.

classical many-body molecular dynamics (MB-MD) and normal mode (NM) calculations to obtain molecular level information on the spectroscopic signatures in the OH
stretching region for all seven of the known ordered crystalline ice phases. The classical
MB-MD spectra are shown to capture the important spectral features by comparing
with experimental Raman spectra. This motivates the use of the classical simulations
in understanding the spectral features of the various ordered ice phases in molecular
terms. This is achieved through NM analysis to first demonstrate that the MB-MD
spectra can be well recovered through the transition dipole moments and polarizability
tensors calculated from each NM. From the normal mode calculations, measures of the
amount of symmetric and antisymmetric stretching are calculated for each ice, as well
as an approximation of how localized each mode is. These metrics aid in viewing the
ice phases on a continuous spectrum determined by their density. As in ice Ih, it is
found that most of the other ordered ice phases have highly delocalized modes and
their spectral features cannot, in general, be described in terms of molecular normal
modes. The lone exception is ice VIII, the densest crystalline ice phase. Despite being
found only at high pressure, the symmetry index shows a clear separation of symmetric
and antisymmetric stretching modes giving rise to two distinct features.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>We build on results from our previous investigation into ice Ih using a combination of

As costs of data generation decrease, experimental design is moving towards measurement of many different samples, such as different patients, conditions, or treatments. While scalability is a challenge on its own, dealing with large experimental design presents a whole new set of problems, such as large-scale batch effects and sample comparison issues. Currently, there are no computational tools that can both handle large amounts of data in a scalable manner (many cells) and at the same time deal with many samples (many patients). Moreover, data analysis currently involves the use of different tools that each operate on their own data representation, not guaranteeing a synchronized analysis pipeline, such as a visualization that matches the clustering. For this purpose, we present SAUCIE, a deep neural network that leverages the high degree of parallelization and scalability offered by neural networks, as well as the deep representation of data that can be learned by them. A well-known limitation of neural networks is their interpretability. Our key contribution here is to constrain and regularize the layers with newly formulated regularizations such that their features become interpretable. When large multipatient datasets are fed into SAUCIE, the layers contain denoised and batch-normalized data, a low dimensional visualization, unsupervised clustering, as well as other information that can be used to explore the data. We show this capability by analyzing a newly generated 180-sample dataset consisting of T cells from dengue patients in India, measured with mass cytometry. We show that SAUCIE, for the first time, can batch normalize and process this 11-million cell data identify cluster-based signatures of acute dengue infection and create a patient manifold, stratifying immune response to dengue on the basis of single-cell measurements.</content></content><title>Exploring Single-Cell Data with Deep Multitasking Neural Networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/237065v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><author><name>Amodio, M.</name></author><published>1535353200000</published><fingerprint>9a77c7f9</fingerprint><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/237065v2?rss=1</link><description>High-throughput, high-dimensional single-cell data is accumulating at a staggering rate.

due to their nature and the diseases they are known to carry. If you look past
their malicious behavior, it is easy to see that nature has provided us a means
to solve one of medicine’s most challenging aspects – effective, localized drug
delivery. Therapeutics have made a great deal of headway since their first
introduction, but sadly we still fall short when it comes to the two
aforementioned issues. Virus-like particles such as the Qβ capsid allow us to
tackle this issue head on by utilizing the non-infectious versions of a parent
virus as a vessel we can load cancer drugs into and further functionalize to
suit our intended goals.
We seek to use the Qβ capsid, which upon
self-assembly in its E.coli host
system, encapsulates random tangles of mRNA. This allows us to use
intercalating therapeutics such as Doxorubicin, which can be bound reversibly
to the RNA inside through simple diffusion of the small molecule through any of
the 32 pores on the capsid’s surface. In our lab, it has been demonstrated that
the efficacy of Dox loading and that the capsid does not leak Dox over a 24-hour
period. Further modification can be made to the drug carrier using the
disulfide lined pores of Qβ – the addition of gold salts (HAuCl4)
and sodium borohydride as a reducing agent allows for the templated growth of gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the capsid surface (Figure A). Molecular modeling
performed by the Nielsen group (Figures B-D) indicates that the nanoparticle
sits within the pore of the viral capsid such the surrounding proteins fold
around the growing sphere to provide stability and confine the particle size.
The hexameric pores of Qβ are predicted to cover 23% of the AuNP surface whilst
the pentameric more only cover about 9% indicating that these particles may not
be as tightly held to the VLP and may be more unstable than their hexameric
counterparts. The addition of the AuNPs to the Qβ capsid was
intended to give a mechanism of release for our drug delivery system, depicted
in Figure E, which utilizes intercalated Doxorubicin (Dox) and improve the
localization of this release. It is postulated that a single pulse from a laser
centered at 532 nm – a value close to the absorbance λmax of our
AuNPs – generates localized heating of the AuNPs causing small changes in the
protein structure allowing the Dox to be released. This has been corroborated
with through the use of circular dichroism to monitor changes in the capsid
protein’s secondary structure as can be seen in Figure F by the decrease in the
peak depth at 220 nm which indicates distortion of the β-sheets. It is also
clear through cell studies with RAW 264.7 cells that laser irradiation releases
the Doxorubicin from the capsid and additionally, when the laser beam is
confined in size to about 1.3 mm, cells that do not receive stimulation do not
release the drug. This can be visualized in Figure G where there is a clear
line of demarcation where Dox release can be seen from the cells within the
laser path. We even went one step further to demonstrate the selectivity of the
system for green laser light. The experiment was repeated using a longer
wavelength of light, 1064 nm, which is outside of the absorption of the
nanoparticles and it yielded no Dox release under this wavelength.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Viruses tend to be given a negative connotation

The thorough investigation of such materials through chemical diversification, gas adsorption measurements, and in situ structural characterization is therefore crucial for broadening their utility. We examine a series of isoreticular, flexible zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) of the type M(bim)2 (SOD; M = Zn (ZIF-7), Co (ZIF-9), Cd (CdIF-13); bim– = benzimidazolate), and elucidate the effects of metal substitution on the pressure-responsive phase changes and the resulting CO2 and CH4 step positions, pre-step uptakes, and step capacities. Using ZIF-7 as a benchmark, we reexamine the poorly understood structural transition responsible for its adsorption steps and, through high-pressure adsorption measurements, verify that it displays a step in its CH4 adsorption isotherms. The ZIF-9 material is shown to undergo an analogous phase change, yielding adsorption steps for CO2 and CH4 with similar profiles and capacities to ZIF-7, but with shifted threshold pressures. Further, the Cd2+ analogue CdIF-13 is reported here for the first time, and shown to display adsorption behavior distinct from both ZIF-7 and ZIF-9, with negligible pre-step adsorption, a ~50% increase in CO2 and CH4 capacity, and dramatically higher threshold adsorption pressures. Remarkably, a single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase change to a pore-gated phase is also achieved with CdIF-13, providing insight into the phase change that yields step-shaped adsorption in these flexible ZIFs. Finally, we show that the endothermic phase change of these frameworks provides intrinsic heat management during gas adsorption.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Metal–organic frameworks that display step-shaped adsorption profiles arising from discrete pressure-induced phase changes are promising materials for applications in both high-capacity gas storage and energy-efficient gas separations.

Dynamic models of large-scale brain activity have been used for reproducing many empirical findings on human brain functional connectivity. Features that have been shown to be reproducible by comparing modeled to empirical data include functional connectivity measured over several minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as its time-resolved fluctuations on a time scale of tens of seconds. However, comparison of modeled and empirical data has not been conducted yet for fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity, such as fluctuations between segregated and integrated topology or between high and low modularity topology. Since these global network-level fluctuations have been shown to be related to human cognition and behavior, there is an emerging need for clarifying their reproducibility with computational models. To address this problem, we directly compared fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity between modeled and empirical data, and clarified the degree to which a stationary model of spontaneous brain dynamics can reproduce the empirically observed fluctuations. Modeled fluctuations were simulated using a system of coupled phase oscillators wired according to brain structural connectivity. By performing model parameter search, we found that modeled fluctuations in global metrics quantifying network integration and modularity had more than 80% of magnitudes of those observed in the empirical data. Temporal properties of network states determined based on fluctuations in these metrics were also found to be reproducible, although their spatial patterns in functional connectivity did not perfectly marched. These results suggest that stationary models simulating resting-state activity can reproduce the magnitude of empirical fluctuations in segregation and integration, whereas additional factors, such as active mechanisms controlling non-stationary dynamics and/or greater accuracy of mapping brain structural connectivity, would be necessary for fully reproducing the spatial patterning associated with these fluctuations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sr-8OBw5Vvo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Comparison of fluctuations in global network topology of modeled and empirical brain functional connectivity</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sr-8OBw5Vvo/article</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006497.g001</url><height>253</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><width>320</width></visual><author><name>Makoto Fukushima</name></author><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1537909200000</published><fingerprint>65e370e6</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006497</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Makoto Fukushima, Olaf Sporns&lt;/p&gt;
Dynamic models of large-scale brain activity have been used for reproducing many empirical findings on human brain functional connectivity. Features that have been shown to be reproducible by comparing modeled to empirical data include functional connectivity measured over several minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as its time-resolved fluctuations on a time scale of tens of seconds. However, comparison of modeled and empirical data has not been conducted yet for fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity, such as fluctuations between segregated and integrated topology or between high and low modularity topology. Since these global network-level fluctuations have been shown to be related to human cognition and behavior, there is an emerging need for clarifying their reproducibility with computational models. To address this problem, we directly compared fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity between modeled and empirical data, and clarified the degree to which a stationary model of spontaneous brain dynamics can reproduce the empirically observed fluctuations. Modeled fluctuations were simulated using a system of coupled phase oscillators wired according to brain structural connectivity. By performing model parameter search, we found that modeled fluctuations in global metrics quantifying network integration and modularity had more than 80% of magnitudes of those observed in the empirical data. Temporal properties of network states determined based on fluctuations in these metrics were also found to be reproducible, although their spatial patterns in functional connectivity did not perfectly marched. These results suggest that stationary models simulating resting-state activity can reproduce the magnitude of empirical fluctuations in segregation and integration, whereas additional factors, such as active mechanisms controlling non-stationary dynamics and/or greater accuracy of mapping brain structural connectivity, would be necessary for fully reproducing the spatial patterning associated with these fluctuations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sr-8OBw5Vvo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1537898608254</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006497</originId><updated>1537909200000</updated><recrawled>1537899488524</recrawled><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006497</href></item></canonical></item><item><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165edc57a3c:149e8db:bfb8468</id><updateCount>1</updateCount><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrey Babichev, Dmitriy Morozov, Yuri Dabaghian&lt;/p&gt;
The spiking activity of principal cells in mammalian hippocampus encodes an internalized neuronal representation of the ambient space—a cognitive map. Once learned, such a map enables the animal to navigate a given environment for a long period. However, the neuronal substrate that produces this map is transient: the synaptic connections in the hippocampus and in the downstream neuronal networks never cease to form and to deteriorate at a rapid rate. How can the brain maintain a robust, reliable representation of space using a network that constantly changes its architecture? We address this question using a computational framework that allows evaluating the effect produced by the decaying connections between simulated hippocampal neurons on the properties of the cognitive map. Using novel Algebraic Topology techniques, we demonstrate that emergence of stable cognitive maps produced by networks with transient architectures is a generic phenomenon. The model also points out that deterioration of the cognitive map caused by weakening or lost connections between neurons may be compensated by simulating the neuronal activity. Lastly, the model explicates the importance of the complementary learning systems for processing spatial information at different levels of spatiotemporal granularity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gbbOgT7E6ek&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Robust spatial memory maps encoded by networks with transient connections</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/gbbOgT7E6ek/article</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006433.g001</url><height>169</height><contentType>image/png</contentType><width>320</width></visual><author><name>Andrey Babichev</name></author><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><published>1537304400000</published><fingerprint>888b3bb4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006433</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrey Babichev, Dmitriy Morozov, Yuri Dabaghian&lt;/p&gt;

This work resulted in the complete assembly of one circular chromosome, ten circular plasmids and one linear phage from P. stewartii DC283. A high number of sequences encoding repetitive transposases (&gt; 400) were found in the complete genome. The separation of plasmids from genomic DNA revealed that two Type III secretion systems in P. stewartii DC283 are located on two separate mega-plasmids. Interestingly, the assembly identified a previously unknown 66-kb region in a location interior to a contig in the previous reference genome. Overall, a novel approach was successfully utilized to fully assemble a prokaryotic genome that contains large numbers of repetitive sequences and multiple plasmids, which resulted in some interesting biological findings.</content></content><title>Expanded Analysis of the Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii DC283 Complete Genome Reveals Plasmid-borne Virulence Factors [NEW RESULTS]</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407825v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Duong, D.

Overall, a novel approach was successfully utilized to fully assemble a prokaryotic genome that contains large numbers of repetitive sequences and multiple plasmids, which resulted in some interesting biological findings.</description><crawled>1536055181809</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407825v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/04/407825</canonicalUrl></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_165eccf50c6:2b307c:6f86c10b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the archive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the archive, Published online: 18 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06689-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06689-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What Nature was saying 50 and 100 years ago.</content></content><title>From the archive</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06689-3</href></item></alternate><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><entities><item><label>Isambard Kingdom Brunel</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Isambard Kingdom Brunel</id><mentions><item><text>Brunel</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Great Western Railway</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Great Western Railway</id><mentions><item><text>Great Western Railway</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>daily Nature Briefing</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/daily nature briefing</id><mentions><item><text>daily Nature Briefing</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Great Britain</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Great Britain</id><mentions><item><text>Great Britain</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><label>Falkland Islands</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Falkland Islands</id><mentions><item><text>Falkland Islands</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06689-3/d41586-018-06689-3_15948434.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1537254000000</published><fingerprint>4be48c93</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06689-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the archive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the archive, Published online: 18 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06689-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-06689-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What Nature was saying 50 and 100 years ago.</description><crawled>1537276334278</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06689-3</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin></item><item><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_165ee7d73e1:15c170c:53cf127c</id><published>1537243200000</published><title>[ASAP] A Cyclic Peptide Inhibitor of the iNOS–SPSB Protein–Protein Interaction as a Potential Anti-Infective Agent</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/acbcct/~3/5iXUIX46SSA/acschembio.8b00561</href></item></alternate><engagement>1</engagement><unread>True</unread><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00561/20180918/images/medium/cb-2018-00561k_0008.gif</url><height>244</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><width>500</width></visual><author><name>Maiada M.

Two main mechanisms that differ in the reaction sequence of substrate were explored: styrene with NBS then followed by 2‐aminopyridine (M1) or simultaneously with NBS and 2‐aminopyridine (M2), and water‐assisted M2 is the more favored one. We found that the adding sequence of 2‐aminopyridine affects profoundly on the title reaction. Moreover, upon the assistance of water and NBS, the preferential mechanistic scenario involves three major processes: nucleophilic addition, stepwise H‐shift and intramolecular cyclization, three‐step deprotonation, rather than a classical bromonium ion species. Specifically, the cooperative interaction of NBS and water plays a critical role in the title reaction. Water acts as solvent, reactant, anchoring, stabilizer, and catalyst. NBS promotes the above three processes by the effective forms of Br+/Br−, succinimide, and its ethanol isomer.

Two main mechanisms that differ in the reaction sequence of substrate were explored: styrene with NBS then followed by 2‐aminopyridine (M1) or simultaneously with NBS and 2‐aminopyridine (M2), and water‐assisted M2 is the more favored one. We found that the adding sequence of 2‐aminopyridine affects profoundly on the title reaction. Moreover, upon the assistance of water and NBS, the preferential mechanistic scenario involves three major processes: nucleophilic addition, stepwise H‐shift and intramolecular cyclization, three‐step deprotonation, rather than a classical bromonium ion species. Specifically, the cooperative interaction of NBS and water plays a critical role in the title reaction. Water acts as solvent, reactant, anchoring, stabilizer, and catalyst. NBS promotes the above three processes by the effective forms of Br+/Br−, succinimide, and its ethanol isomer. Furthermore, noncovalent interactions between catalysts and substrates are responsible for the different reactive activities of M1 and M2.

They’ve been doing a lot of work on an antibiotic scaffold (arylomycins, &lt;em&gt;Update: on a program that came in whey they bought RQx&lt;/em&gt;) which had not thus far really found much practical use, and it looks like they’ve found what could be a valuable drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://aac.asm.org/content/56/10/5054&quot;&gt;arylomycins&lt;/a&gt; are natural product antibiotics, but they’re not particularly potent, and have found no use in the clinic. That’s a shame, because their target is of great interest: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/fmb.11.109&quot;&gt;signal peptidase&lt;/a&gt;. Those are  key enzymes in an important bacterial signaling pathway, and inhibiting them should lead to all sorts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5279723/&quot;&gt;useful effects&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a funny enzyme, though – it uses a catalytic mechanism (serine/lysine dyad) that you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488913004229&quot;&gt;don’t see much&lt;/a&gt;, and which traditional serine-active-site targeting compounds don’t seem to hit. I should mention that I have personal (unpublished) experience with things that don’t hit signal peptidase I, and I can testify to what a difficult-to-target enzyme class it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/G0775-300x245.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/G0775-300x245.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/G0775-768x627.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/G0775-1024x837.jpeg 1024w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/G0775.jpeg 1136w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13822&quot; height=&quot;245&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So any chemical matter that does hit this is worth following up on, but it’s been a hard slog (as it is with all novel antibiotic targets). The Genentech team have put in the work, though, and have extensively modified Arylomycin A while keeping its (essential and funky, for a natural product) biphenyl-peptide-macrolide core, in keeping with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi9009538&quot;&gt;clues&lt;/a&gt; from the known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277211/&quot;&gt;crystal structures&lt;/a&gt; of inhibitor-bound enzyme (see the structures at right). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/genentech-antibiotic-quells-resistance/3009495.article&quot;&gt;Here’s a writeup&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Chemistry World&lt;/em&gt; if you don’t have access to the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper, which will give you the main points. The really good news is that the new compounds are potent and efficacious, even against nasty resistant clinical isolates. That’s probably because they’ve never been punched right in the signal peptidase pathway before, and encouragingly, it seems that resistance itself emerges only slowly on repeated exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes across as you read the paper, though, is the empirical nature of antibiotic discovery. The peptidase enzyme that G0775 targets is on the inner membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria, so that means you have to get through the outer membrane first. Experiments with defective mutant bacteria indicated that the molecule could actually do that, although you wouldn’t have expected much given its structure. Most antibiotics make it into bacteria through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_bacterial_porin_family&quot;&gt;porins&lt;/a&gt;, but G0775 apparently manages to bypass that route, and it’s not quite clear how. That alone is definitely worth further study – it’s known that that classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymyxin&quot;&gt;polymixin antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; can do this, but G0775 is active (fortunately) against strains with membrane mutations that make them polymyxin-resistant. So there’s something quite interesting going on, and it’s not like we know how to design for it. Also worth noting is that it would seem that G0775 not only makes it in, but manages to not get pumped back out very efficiently either. That’s a common problem with antibiotic lead compounds, and designing away from that is pretty much a black-box process, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the G0775 story represents a great deal of hard work, expertise, and the use of all the tools we have at our disposal in modern drug discovery. But it also has a bit of luck in it. But remember what one of the fathers of bacteriology – Pasteur – had to say about luck in research: “Fortune favors the prepared mind”. And if you’re going to have a successful antibiotic research program, you have to be ready to try a great number of approaches, being as diligent and intelligent as you can, and be ready to run with whatever works.

In contrast to reference force fields, this model reproduces the correct crystal structures for all alkali halides at low and high temperature.

These artificial poles can be avoidedby skipping the amplitude response and reverting to a sum-over-states formulation.

Point mutations and translocations can be detected when they occur in expressed genes, however, there are few software solutions to infer copy number information from RNA-sequencing data. This is because the expression of a gene is dictated by a number of variables, including, but not limited to, copy number variation. Here, we report new functionalities within the software package CNVkit that enable copy number inference from RNA-sequencing data. First, CNVkit removes technical variation in gene expression associated with GC-content and transcript length. Next, CNVkit assigns a weight, dictated by several variables, to each transcript with the net effect of preferentially inferring copy number from highly and stably expressed genes.

After initial configuration, the software requires few inputs, is able to process a batch of up to 100 samples in less than ten minutes, and can be used in conjunction with pre-existing features of CNVkit, including visualization tools.

Failure of resolution contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM biosynthesis. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes resolution, inhibition of ERK activation delayed resolution, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates.

The investigation of RNA-based regulation of cellular processes is becoming an increasingly important part of biological or medical research. For the analysis of this type of data, RNA-related prediction tools are integrated into many pipelines and workflows. In order to correctly apply and tune these programs, the user has to have a precise understanding of their limitations and concepts. Within this manuscript, we provide the mathematical foundations and extract the algorithmic ideas that are core to state-of-the-art RNA structure and RNA–RNA interaction prediction algorithms. To allow the reader to change and adapt the algorithms or to play with different inputs, we provide an open-source web interface to JavaScript implementations and visualizations of each algorithm. The conceptual, teaching-focused presentation enables a high-level survey of the approaches, while providing sufficient details for understanding important concepts. This is boosted by the simple generation and study of examples using the web interface available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/. In combination, we provide a valuable resource for teaching, learning, and understanding the discussed prediction tools and thus enable a more informed analysis of RNA-related effects.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1_pSZRr6Y0c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Interactive implementations of thermodynamics-based RNA structure and RNA–RNA interaction prediction approaches for example-driven teaching</title><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1_pSZRr6Y0c/article</href></item></alternate><engagement>7</engagement><unread>True</unread><author><name>Martin Raden</name></author><recrawled>1535652733863</recrawled><published>1535662800000</published><fingerprint>f8921905</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006341</link><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martin Raden, Mostafa Mahmoud Mohamed, Syed Mohsin Ali, Rolf Backofen&lt;/p&gt;

This is boosted by the simple generation and study of examples using the web interface available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/. In combination, we provide a valuable resource for teaching, learning, and understanding the discussed prediction tools and thus enable a more informed analysis of RNA-related effects.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1_pSZRr6Y0c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1535651154051</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl></origin><updated>1535662800000</updated><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006341</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006341</href></item></canonical></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_165b013133a:d40e41:4c71e4fe</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Plant immunity often penalizes growth and yield.
