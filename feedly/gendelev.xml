In shotgun sequencing, regions of CNAs show step-wise changes in read depth when compared to adjacent &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; regions, allowing their detection by parametric statistical tests that compare the mean coverage in suspected regions against that of a baseline distribution. Traditionally, the power of such a test depends on (1) the integer number of copy number change, (2) the overall sequencing depth, (3) the length of the CNA region, (4) the read length and (5) the variation of coverage along the genome, which depends on many experimental factors, including whether the chosen platform is whole-genome, whole-exome, or targeted-panel sequencing. In cases involving inadvertent sample mixing or genuine somatic mosaicism, power also depends on the mixing ratio. However, the analysis of statistical power that considers the interplay of all these factors has not been systematically developed. Here we present a general analytical framework and a series of simulations that explore situations from the simplest to the increasingly multifactorial. Specifically, we expand the expression of power to include not just the known factors but also one or both of two complications: (1) the dispersion of read depth around the mean beyond the independent sampling-by-sequencing assumption, and (2) the reduced fraction of the CNA-bearing sample (&amp;quot;purity&amp;quot;) as seen in studies of intratumor heterogeneity or in clinical monitoring of minimal residual disease. We describe the analytical formula and their simplifications in special cases, and share the extendable scripts for others to perform customized power analysis using study-specific parameters. As study designs vary and technologies continue to evolve, the input data and the noise characteristics will change depending on the practical situation. We present two use cases commonly encountered in cancer research: ultra-shallow whole-genome sequencing for detecting large, chromosome-scale events, and targeted ultra-deep sequencing for surveillance of known CNAs in rare tumor clones in the task of sensitive detection of cancer relapse or metastasis.

RNA-Seq data are large, and most commonly used as a source of gene-level quantification measurements, whilst the underlying assemblies of reads, if inspected, are usually viewed as sequence reads mapped on to a reference genome. Whilst sufficient for many needs, when the underlying transcript assemblies are complex, this visualisation approach can be limiting; errors in assembly can be difficult to spot and interpretation of splicing events is challenging. Here we report on the development of a graph-based visualisation method as a complementary approach to understanding transcript diversity and read assembly from short-read RNA-Seq data. Following the mapping of reads to the reference genome, read-to-read comparison is performed on all reads mapping to a given gene, producing a matrix of weighted similarity scores between reads. This is used to produce an RNA assembly graph where nodes represent reads derived from a cDNA and edges similarity scores between reads, above a defined threshold. Visualisation of resulting graphs is performed using Graphia Professional. This tool can render the often large and complex graph topologies that result from DNA/RNA sequence assembly in 3D space and supports information overlay on to nodes, e.g. transcript models. We have also implemented an analysis pipeline for the creation of RNA assembly graphs with both a command-line and web-based interface that allows users to create and visualise these data. Here we demonstrate the utility of this approach on RNA-Seq data, including the unusual structure of these graphs and how they can be used to identify issues in assembly, repetitive sequences within transcripts and splice variants. We believe this approach has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of transcript complexity.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165af685f78:bf90b7:4c71e4fe</id><content><content>RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful transcriptome profiling technology enabling transcript discovery and quantification.

ESCRT proteins participate in the fission step of exocytic membrane budding, by assisting in the closure and scission of the membrane neck that connects the nascent bud to the plasma membrane. However, the precise mechanism by which the proteins achieve this so-called reverse-topology membrane scission remains to be elucidated. One mechanism is described by the &lt;i&gt;dome model&lt;/i&gt;, which postulates that ESCRT-III proteins assemble in the shape of a hemispherical dome at the location of the neck, and guide the closure of this neck &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; membrane–protein adhesion. A different mechanism is described by the &lt;i&gt;flattening cone model&lt;/i&gt;, in which the ESCRT-III complex first assembles at the neck in the shape of a cone, which then flattens leading to neck closure. Here, we use the theoretical framework of curvature elasticity and membrane–protein adhesion to quantitatively describe and compare both mechanisms. This comparison shows that the minimal adhesive strength of the membrane–protein interactions required for scission is much lower for cones than for domes, and that the geometric constraints on the shape of the assembly required to induce scission are more stringent for domes than for cones. Finally, we compute for the first time the adhesion-induced constriction forces exerted by the ESCRT assemblies onto the membrane necks. These forces are higher for cones and of the order of 100 pN.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/p98M67IYI2Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1655d9115d2:14a233:3da9d93</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006422</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Reinhard Lipowsky&lt;/p&gt;

Integrated Information Theory (IIT) has become nowadays the most sensible general theory of consciousness. In addition to very important statements, it opens the door for an abstract (mathematical) formulation of the theory. Given a mechanism in a particular state, IIT identifies a conscious experience with a conceptual structure, an informational object which exists, is composed of identified parts, is informative, integrated and maximally irreducible. This paper introduces a space-time continuous version of the concept of integrated information. To this aim, a graph and a dynamical systems treatment is used to define, for a given mechanism in a state for which a dynamics is settled, an &lt;i&gt;Informational Structure&lt;/i&gt;, which is associated to the global attractor at each time of the system. By definition, the informational structure determines all the past and future behavior of the system, possesses an informational nature and, moreover, enriches all the points of the phase space with cause-effect power by means of its associated Informational Field. A detailed description of its inner structure by invariants and connections between them allows to associate a transition probability matrix to each informational structure and to develop a measure for the level of integrated information of the system.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dzzK7PEMzuo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165d4221454:db03e3:6f86c10b</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006154</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francisco J.

For example, gene expression is accurately measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries, protein-DNA interactions are captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), protein-RNA interactions by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP-Seq) or RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP-Seq) sequencing, DNA accessibility by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-Seq), and DNase or MNase sequencing libraries. Analysis of these sequencing techniques involve library-specific approaches.

Differential analysis to determine which loci have different cellular activity under different conditions starts with the count table and iterates through a cycle of data assessment, preparation and analysis. Such iterative approach relies on multiple programs and is therefore a challenge for those without programming skills. Results: We developed DEBrowser, as an R bioconductor project, to interactively visualize each step of the differential analysis of count data, without any requirement for programming expertise. The application presents a rich and interactive web based graphical user interface based on R&apos;s shiny infrastructure. We use shiny&apos;s reactive programming interface for a dynamic webpage that responds to user input and integrates its visualization widgets at each stage of the analysis. In this way, every step of the analysis can be displayed in one application that combines many approaches and multiple results. We show DEBrowser&apos;s capabilities by reproducing the analysis of two previously published data sets.

Such waves can organize into spirals, rotating around a core, whose properties determine the overall wave dynamics. Theoretically, manipulation of a spiral wave core should lead to full spatiotemporal control over its dynamics. However, this theory lacks supportive evidence (even at a conceptual level), making it thus a long-standing hypothesis. Here, we propose a new phenomenological concept that involves artificially dragging spiral waves by their cores, to prove the afore-mentioned hypothesis in silico, with subsequent in vitro validation in optogenetically-modified monolayers of rat atrial cardiomyocytes. We thereby connect previously established, but unrelated concepts of spiral wave attraction, anchoring and unpinning to demonstrate that core manipulation, through controlled displacement of heterogeneities in excitable media, allows forced movement of spiral waves along pre-defined trajectories. Consequently, we impose real-time spatiotemporal control over spiral wave dynamics in a biological system.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165c87646bb:1ec2d09:6f86c10b</id><content><content>Propagation of non-linear waves is key to the functioning of diverse biological systems.

METHODS: We applied our INFERNO method to the IGAP genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, annotating all potentially causal variants with tissue-specific regulatory activity. Bayesian co-localization analysis of GWAS summary statistics and eQTL data was performed to identify tissue-specific target genes. RESULTS: INFERNO identified enhancer dysregulation in all 19 tag regions analyzed, significant enrichments of enhancer overlaps in the immune-related blood category, and co-localized eQTL signals overlapping enhancers from the matching tissue class in ten regions (ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD2AP, CD33, CELF1, CLU, EPHA1, FERMT2, ZCWPW1).

Because of the high-throughput nature of mass spectrometric analyses, the interpretation of these chromatographic data increasingly relies on informatics solutions that attempt to predict an analyte&apos;s retention time. The key components of such predictive algorithms are the features these are supplies with, and the actual machine learning algorithm used to fit the model parameters. We here therefore evaluate the performance of seven machine learning algorithms on 36 distinct metabolomics data sets, using two distinct feature sets. Interestingly, the results show that no single learning algorithm performs optimally for all data sets, with different algorithm types achieving top performance for different types of analytes or different protocols. Our results can thus be used to and an optimal retention time prediction algorithm for specific analytes or protocols. Importantly, however, our results also show that blending different types of models together decreases the error on outliers, indicating that the combination of several approaches holds substantial promise for the development of more generic, high-performing algorithms.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165ab14d335:60acd5:4c71e4fe</id><content><content>Liquid chromatography is a core component of almost all mass spectrometric analyses of (bio)molecules.

Importantly, however, our results also show that blending different types of models together decreases the error on outliers, indicating that the combination of several approaches holds substantial promise for the development of more generic, high-performing algorithms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c37bb2f9</fingerprint></item><item><published>1535328000000</published><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>NA</name></author><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Role_of_the_Chemical_Shift_Difference_in_a_Two-Site_Exchange_Model_Under_an_On-Resonance_Spin-Lock_RF_Field/7011707</link><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>The Role of the Chemical Shift Difference in a Two-Site Exchange Model Under an On-Resonance Spin-Lock RF Field</title><crawled>1535378760502</crawled><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Role_of_the_Chemical_Shift_Difference_in_a_Two-Site_Exchange_Model_Under_an_On-Resonance_Spin-Lock_RF_Field/7011707</originId><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Role_of_the_Chemical_Shift_Difference_in_a_Two-Site_Exchange_Model_Under_an_On-Resonance_Spin-Lock_RF_Field/7011707</href></item></alternate><description>The manuscript investigates the role of the chemical shift difference between two exchanging pools under a spin-lock RF field.

High-throughput experimental approaches, though having successfully reported enhancers in typical cell lines, are still too costly and time consuming to perform systematic identification of enhancers specific to different cell lines under a variety of disease status.

Recent studies have suggested that chromatin accessibility of a DNA segment is closely related to its potential function in regulation, and thus may provide useful information in identifying regulatory elements.

We proposed DeepCAPE, a deep convolutional neural network to predict enhancers via the integration of DNA sequences and DNase-seq data.

a dye frequently used in the textile industry and a potential wastewater
pollutant. MB adsorption onto the surface of solid materials is a promising
method for wastewater remediation. The biopolymer chitosan is one of the promising
candidates as an adsorbent for MB removal from wastewater. However, the contact
between MB and chitosan induces the aggregation of MB molecules. The formation
of MB aggregates can lead to an appearance of additional bands in the MB
visible absorption spectrum. This phenomenon is called metachromasy. In this
paper, chitosan was used as adsorbent to study the kinetics and thermodynamic
parameters related to the elimination of MB as single molecules (Sng-MB) and
aggregates (Agg-MB) species from simulated wastewater. It was found that, for
MB single molecules or aggregates, the adsorption process follows the pseudo
second order adsorption kinetics model. For each temperature studied, Agg-MB
always presented higher rate constant than Sng-MB, indicating a faster
adsorption of Agg-MB in comparison to Sng-MB. Additionally, the adsorption process presented a lower activation energy
for Agg-MB, indicating Agg-MB adsorption is favored in relation to Sng-MB. The
thermodynamic studies indicated the adsorption process for both MB species is
endothermic and spontaneous from 298 to 348 K. The adsorption isotherms could
be properly fitted and interpreted according to Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich
models. Studies varying the initial pH of MB solution indicated that
metachromasy could be suppressed in acidic pH values, whereas alkaline pH
values led to an increase in the removal percentage of Sng-MB and Agg-MB in
relation to neutral conditions. The analysis of chitosan powder before and
after adsorption indicated the adsorption process does not cause structural
changes to the chitosan. The kinetic and thermodynamic study of the relative
adsorption of MB single molecules and aggregates onto chitosan can provide
fundamental information for MB wastewater remediation.</description><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_165ce1ae0ed:435442:4db7ac35</id><summary><content>Methylene Blue (MB) is

We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell surface abundance of c during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of c was low on CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORt was abundant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the abundance of surface c, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding c, RORt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; to reduce the abundance of surface c, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; in RORt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of surface c to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORt and Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; in limiting c abundance at the cell surface and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the abundance and surface distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_16581c7660f:bfc77d:b99eedab</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;The cytokine receptor subunit c provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation.

Current 16S profiling methods, however, fail to provide sufficient taxonomic resolution and accuracy to adequately perform species-level associative studies for specific conditions. This is due to the amplification and sequencing of only short 16S rRNA gene regions, typically providing for only family- or genus-level taxonomy. Moreover, sequencing errors often inflate the number of taxa present. Pacific Biosciences&apos; (PacBio&apos;s) long-read technology in particular suffers from high error rates per base. Herein we present a microbiome analysis pipeline that takes advantage of PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) technology to sequence and error correct full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes, which provides high-fidelity species-level microbiome data. Results: Analysis of a mock community with 20 bacterial species demonstrated 100% specificity and sensitivity. Examination of a 250-plus species mock community demonstrated correct species-level classification of &gt;90% of taxa and relative abundances were accurately captured. The majority of the remaining taxa were demonstrated to be multiply, incorrectly, or incompletely classified. Using this methodology, we examined the microgeographic variation present among the microbiomes of six sinonasal sites, by both swab and biopsy, from the anterior nasal cavity to the sphenoid sinus from 12 subjects undergoing trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. We found greater variation among subjects than among sites within a subject, although significant within-individual differences were also observed. Propiniobacterium acnes (recently renamed Cutibacterium acnes [1]) was the predominant species throughout, but was found at distinct relative abundances by site. Conclusions: Our microbial composition analysis pipeline for single-molecule real-time 16S rRNA gene sequencing (MCSMRT, https://github.com/jpearl01/mcsmrt) overcomes deficits of standard marker gene based microbiome analyses by using CCS of entire 16S rRNA genes to provide increased taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution. Extensions of this approach to other marker genes could help refine taxonomic assignments of microbial species and improve reference databases, as well as strengthen the specificity of associations between microbial communities and dysbiotic states.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1658c3767f5:da121e:4c71e4fe</id><content><content>Background: Pan-bacterial 16S rRNA microbiome surveys performed with massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies have transformed community microbiological studies.

The humoral immune response involves uptake of antigens by antigen presenting cells (APCs), APC processing and presentation of peptides on MHC class II (pMHCII), and T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of pMHCII complexes. Most in silico methods predict only peptide-MHCII binding, resulting in significant over-prediction of CD4 T-cell epitopes. We present a method, ITCell, for prediction of T-cell epitopes within an input protein antigen sequence for given MHCII and TCR sequences. The method integrates information about three stages of the immune response pathway: antigen cleavage, MHCII presentation, and TCR recognition. First, antigen cleavage sites are predicted based on the cleavage profiles of cathepsins S, B, and H. Second, for each 12-mer peptide in the antigen sequence we predict whether it will bind to a given MHCII, based on the scores of modeled peptide-MHCII complexes. Third, we predict whether or not any of the top scoring peptide-MHCII complexes can bind to a given TCR, based on the scores of modeled ternary peptide-MHCII-TCR complexes and the distribution of predicted cleavage sites. Our benchmarks consist of epitope predictions generated by this algorithm, checked against 20 peptide-MHCII-TCR crystal structures, as well as epitope predictions for four peptide-MHCII-TCR complexes with known epitopes and TCR sequences but without crystal structures. ITCell successfully identified the correct epitopes as one of the 20 top scoring peptides for 22 of 24 benchmark cases. To validate the method using a clinically relevant application, we utilized five factor VIII-specific TCR sequences from hemophilia A subjects who developed an immune response to factor VIII replacement therapy. The known HLA-DR1-restricted factor VIII epitope was among the six top-scoring factor VIII peptides predicted by ITCall to bind HLA-DR1 and all five TCRs. Our integrative approach is more accurate than current single-stage epitope prediction algorithms applied to the same benchmarks. It is freely available as a web server (http://salilab.org/itcell).</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165d4f1eefb:e9650c:4c71e4fe</id><content><content>Accurate predictions of T-cell epitopes would be useful for designing vaccines, immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases, and improved protein therapies.

However, some paired-end sequencing data show the presence of a subpopulation of reads where the second read has lower average qualities. We show that the fragment length is a major driver of increased error rates in the R2 reads. Fragments above 500 nt tend to yield lower base qualities and higher error rates than shorter fragments. We demonstrate the fragment length dependency of the R2 read qualities using publicly available Illumina data generated by various library protocols, in different labs and using different sequencer models.

It also sheds a light on the importance of the fragmentation during library preparation and the resulting fragment length distribution.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ad5b018d</fingerprint><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6403/657.14.full</canonicalUrl><published>1534441235000</published><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Szuromi, P.</name></author><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6403/657-n?rss=1</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Unmasking the glow of silver clusters</title><crawled>1534442881308</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6403/657-n?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16543ec411c:6e98b53:4c71e4fe</id><keywords><item>Chemistry, Materials Science</item></keywords><fingerprint>dfa94fca</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6403/657-n?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><published>1535958000000</published><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>James H.

A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icij.org/blog/2018/07/new-international-investigation-tackles-fake-science-and-its-poisonous-effects/&quot;&gt;large investigation&lt;/a&gt; reported recently that the number of papers put out by the five largest publishers in this category has tripled since 2015, so there’s clearly an expanding market for such “services”. Among the elite (by which I mean the top layer of this pond scum) are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/09/15/the-ugly-state-of-the-literature-these-days&quot;&gt;Omics group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/08/18/scams-attended-by-frauds&quot;&gt;WASET&lt;/a&gt;, both of whose activities I have covered in past blogs here. Those links will give you a good idea of their operations: they’re scams. No one should give them money, which is the same thing as saying that no one should be publishing with them, because they sure won’t publish a word until your funds deposit. As usual, the problem is that there are indeed legitimate (and more than merely legitimate) open-access publishers that will charge you to publish your paper, too. The difference is that the legitimate ones actually do review and editorial work, funded by those charges, as opposed to the predatory outfits. Their model is publishing every single piece of crap that comes in accompanied by hard currency, and spending not one penny on quality control of any sort, because why would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the government of India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06048-2?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nature%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+-+Issue%29&quot;&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s cracking down on such publications in that country, news that comes not long after word of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/06/11/science-reform-in-china&quot;&gt;far-reaching science oversight&lt;/a&gt; in China. Universities are to remove the predatory publishers from their approved lists, so that papers with them don’t count for promotion, etc. Of course, one reason we got to this point was that India’s system (the “Academic Performance Indicator”) is basically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.natureasia.com/en/nindia/article/10.1038/nindia.2017.114&quot;&gt;set up&lt;/a&gt; to weigh scientific publications by the kilo (a problem China has had, too). You’d hope that this would start to improve things, but I wonder.  One possibility is that the publishers themselves will change names/letterheads/putative locations just enough to stay ahead of the Indian bureaucracy, and from what I’ve heard from my Indian colleagues over the years, staying ahead of the Indian bureaucracy is generally not something that will cause you to break into much of a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outcome seems likely to me based on what’s happened already: the country’s University Grants Commission already put out a “white list” of approved journals in 2017, but it had many predatory outfits on it. Their excuse has been that these were recommended by several universities, and that they only realized later that they were problematic, removing thousands of titles a few months ago. That’s not much of an excuse, honestly – how can you be in charge of putting together such a list and not notice this sort of thing? There also seem to be few consequences for publishing in these venues, so it look like (1) the incentives to crank out such papers will still exist, since they’re still evaluating based on number of publications, (2) the disincentives will be minimal, since you’re not punished in any way for this behavior other than your “papers” not counting if you send them to a title that’s on the current list, and (3) the predatory publishers themselves have every reason to get around this for their own purposes. After all, this is a large customer base and they’re not going to say goodbye to them without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I applaud the Indian authorities for realizing that there’s a problem and at least attempting to do something about it. But they shouldn’t expect too much applause until they demonstrate that what they’re doing has some effect. It shouldn’t be too long before we know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2a78c152</fingerprint><description>There’s more activity on the predatory journal front.

As network analysis and image processing are based on matrices, this research analysed the changes in the chromatin image of lymphocyte nuclei in peripheral blood of humans using a network motif and static features (static parameters), so as to complete image classification with network method. Methods: Image processing technology was used to establish a chromatin image network of a cell nucleus; Network analysis tool Pajek was used to display the special motif of an isolated structural hole with different symmetric line values; afterwards, the frequency of occurrence of this structural hole in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and AIDS, and healthy people was computed. Then by applying the network static features as variables, the chromatin images of stained lymphocytes from the three groups of people were classified and recognised by using an extreme learning machine (ELM). Results: The frequency of occurrence of the isolated structural hole with different symmetric line values was adopted to distinguish the structures of the chromatins of peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and AIDS, and healthy people. Similarly, The static features of the chromatin image network of a cell nucleus were applied to classify and recognise the morphological and structural changes in chromatins for peripheral blood lymphocytes in the three groups of people. Conclusion: The surface chemical and physical characteristics, as well as the polymerisation link status of biomacromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and protein in the lymphocyte nucleus change under certain pathological conditions. The change influences the combination of small molecular staining materials and any associated biomacromolecules. Therefore, various macroscopic and microscopic changes were found in the chromatin images of the cell nucleus. The microscopic changes include the variations of the extent of staining of chromatin in the nuclei, coarseness and direction of the texture therein, the size of stained conglomerations, etc. These changes contribute to the differences in chromatin image networks among the same type of cells across the three groups. Based on this, the model can be used to classify and reorganise certain diseases. The results prove that using complex network to analyse the chromatin structure of a cell nucleus is of significance.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16558a52947:885f4e9:4db7ac35</id><content><content>Background: A complex network has been studied and applied in various disciplines.

However, their individual contributions remain poorly understood. Here we present a systematic approach to integrate both sequencing- and imaging-based single-cell transcriptomic profiles, thereby combining whole-transcriptomic and spatial information from these assays. We applied this approach to dissect the cell-type and spatial domain associated heterogeneity within the mouse visual cortex region. Our analysis identified distinct spatially associated signatures within glutamatergic and astrocyte cell compartments, indicating strong interactions between cells and their surrounding environment. Using these signatures as a guide to analyze single cell RNAseq data, we identified previously unknown, but spatially associated subpopulations. As such, our integrated approach provides a powerful tool for dissecting the roles of intrinsic regulatory networks and spatial environment in the maintenance of cellular states.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165b59059e5:67b20d:cf41b655</id><content><content>Both the intrinsic regulatory network and spatial environment are contributors of cellular identity and result in cell state variations.

Currently, analysis of HDX-MS data remains a laborious procedure, mainly due to the lack of streamlined software to process the large datasets. We present Deuteros which is a standalone soft-ware designed to be coupled with Waters DynamX HDX data analysis software, allowing the rapid analysis and visualization of data from differential HDX-MS. Availability: Deuteros is open-source and can be downloaded from https://github.com/andymlau/Deuteros, under the Apache 2.0 license. Implementation: written in MATLAB and supported on both Windows and MacOS.

This study provides a decisive outcome concluding the accessible SNPs information by recognizing the five harming nsSNPs: rs28934573 (S241F), rs11540652 (R248Q), rs121913342 (R248W), rs121913343 (R273C) and rs28934576 (R273H).

The underlying discoveries are fortified by I-Mutant and Project HOPE. The ExPASy-PROSITE tools characterized whether the mutations located in the functional part of the protein or not. This study provides a decisive outcome concluding the accessible SNPs information by recognizing the five harming nsSNPs: rs28934573 (S241F), rs11540652 (R248Q), rs121913342 (R248W), rs121913343 (R273C) and rs28934576 (R273H). The findings of this investigation recognize the detrimental nsSNPs which enhance the danger of various kinds of oncogenesis in patients of different populations in genome-wide studies (GWS).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>552921ea</fingerprint></item><item><published>1535045409000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><engagement>18</engagement><author><name>Altounian, V., Stampfli, P.</name></author><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6404/eaav1395?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6404/eaav1395.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Cover stories: Making the graphene quasicrystals cover</title><crawled>1535047129607</crawled><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6404/eaav1395?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6404/eaav1395?rss=1</href></item></alternate><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16567f05a07:9d94d1b:4c71e4fe</id><fingerprint>46ee1dc5</fingerprint><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><published>1536044400000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><engagement>3</engagement><author><name>Talevich, E.</name></author><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/408534v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/04/408534</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>CNVkit-RNA: Copy number inference from RNA-Sequencing data [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1536092376622</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/408534v1?rss=1</originId><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/408534v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><description>RNA-sequencing is most commonly used to measure gene expression, but it is possible to extract genotypic information from RNA-sequencing data, too. Point mutations and translocations can be detected when they occur in expressed genes, however, there are few software solutions to infer copy number information from RNA-sequencing data. This is because the expression of a gene is dictated by a number of variables, including, but not limited to, copy number variation. Here, we report new functionalities within the software package CNVkit that enable copy number inference from RNA-sequencing data. First, CNVkit removes technical variation in gene expression associated with GC-content and transcript length. Next, CNVkit assigns a weight, dictated by several variables, to each transcript with the net effect of preferentially inferring copy number from highly and stably expressed genes. We benchmarked our approach on 105 melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas project and observed a high degree of concordance (R = 0.739) between our estimates and those from array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on the same samples. After initial configuration, the software requires few inputs, is able to process a batch of up to 100 samples in less than ten minutes, and can be used in conjunction with pre-existing features of CNVkit, including visualization tools. Overall, we present a rapid, user-friendly software solution to infer copy number information from gene expression data.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165a63d8e2e:2cf3547:4db7ac35</id><content><content>RNA-sequencing is most commonly used to measure gene expression, but it is possible to extract genotypic information from RNA-sequencing data, too.

Learning in biologically relevant neural-network models usually relies on Hebb learning rules. The typical implementations of these rules change the synaptic strength on the basis of the co-occurrence of the neural events taking place at a certain time in the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Differential Hebbian learning (DHL) rules, instead, are able to update the synapse by taking into account the temporal relation, captured with derivatives, between the neural events happening in the recent past. The few DHL rules proposed so far can update the synaptic weights only in few ways: this is a limitation for the study of dynamical neurons and neural-network models. Moreover, empirical evidence on brain spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) shows that different neurons express a surprisingly rich repertoire of different learning processes going far beyond existing DHL rules. This opens up a second problem of how capturing such processes with DHL rules. Here we propose a general DHL (G-DHL) rule generating the existing rules and many others. The rule has a high expressiveness as it combines in different ways the pre- and post- synaptic neuron signals and derivatives. The rule flexibility is shown by applying it to various signals of artificial neurons and by fitting several different STDP experimental data sets. To these purposes, we propose techniques to pre-process the neural signals and capture the temporal relations between the neural events of interest. We also propose a procedure to automatically identify the rule components and parameters that best fit different STDP data sets, and show how the identified components might be used to heuristically guide the search of the biophysical mechanisms underlying STDP. Overall, the results show that the G-DHL rule represents a useful means to study time-sensitive learning processes in both artificial neural networks and brain.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/avC1MDNSqOE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16581aa7842:275e787:d987d511</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006227</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefano Zappacosta, Francesco Mannella, Marco Mirolli, Gianluca Baldassarre&lt;/p&gt;

Our multi-task U-Net deep learning model achieves a Jaccard index of 0.433 on official test data, which ranks the 5th place on the final leaderboard.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fb26102a</fingerprint><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><published>1536860251000</published><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl></origin><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Smith, K.

The standard CVD chemistry for 13-Ns use ammonia as the nitrogen precursor, however, this gives an inefficient CVD chemistry forcing N/13 ratios of 100/1 or more.

Robust analysis of the resulting sequenced rounds is best implemented by determining a ranked consensus of reads following the processing by multiple aptamer detection algorithms. Whilst several such approaches have been developed to this end, their installation and implementation is problematic. We developed AptCompare, a cross-platform program that combines six of the most widely used analytical approaches for the identification of RNA aptamer motifs and uses a simple weighted ranking to order the candidate aptamers, all driven within the same GUI-enabled environment. We demonstrate AptCompare&apos;s performance by identifying the top-ranked candidate aptamers from a previously published selection experiment in our laboratory, with follow-up bench assays demonstrating good correspondence between the sequences&apos; rankings and their binding affinities.

Robust analysis of the resulting sequenced rounds is best implemented by determining a ranked consensus of reads following the processing by multiple aptamer detection algorithms. Whilst several such approaches have been developed to this end, their installation and implementation is problematic.

We present a segmentation protocol which, through the application of persistence based clustering, is capable of probing densely packed structures which vary in scale. An increase in segmentation performance over state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated. Moreover we employ persistence homology to move beyond clustering, and quantify the topological structure within data. This provides new information about the preserved shapes formed by molecular architecture.

In eukaryotes, both 5mC and 5hmC are now recognized as stable epigenetic marks, with diverse functions. Bacteria, archaea, and viruses contain various other modified DNA nucleobases. Numerous databases describe RNA and histone modifications, but no database specifically catalogues DNA modifications, despite their broad importance in epigenetic regulation. To address this need, we have developed DNAmod. DNAmod is an open-source database (https://dnamod.hoffmanlab.org/) that catalogues DNA modifications and provides a single source to learn about their properties. DNAmod provides a web interface to easily browse and search through these modifications. The database annotates the chemical properties and structures of all curated modified DNA bases, and a much larger list of candidate chemical entities. DNAmod includes manual annotations of available sequencing methods, descriptions of their occurrence in nature, and provides existing and suggested nomenclature. DNAmod enables researchers to rapidly review previous work, select mapping techniques, and track recent developments concerning modified bases of interest.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165c4e56470:1976fc6:cf41b655</id><content><content>Covalent DNA modifications, such as 5mC, are increasingly the focus of numerous research programs.

Mechanically ventilated lungs are exposed to an abnormally high mechanical load that may result in clinically relevant alveolar damage. We report that mechanical ventilation in mice increased the expression of Lamin-A, a major determinant of nuclear membrane stiffness, in alveolar epithelial cells. Lamin-A expression increased and nuclear membrane compliance decreased in human bronchial epithelial cells after a mechanical stretch stimulus and in a murine model of lung injury after positive-pressure ventilation. Reducing Lamin-A maturation by depletion of the protease-encoding gene &lt;i&gt;Zmpste24&lt;/i&gt; preserved alveolar nuclear membrane compliance after mechanical ventilation in mice. Ventilator-induced proapoptotic gene expression changes and lung injury were reduced in mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Zmpste24&lt;/i&gt; compared to wild-type control animals. Similarly, treatment with the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir reduced the accumulation of Lamin-A at nuclear membranes and preserved nuclear membrane compliance after mechanical ventilation, mimicking the protective phenotype of &lt;i&gt;Zmpste24&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;–/–&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; animals.

separation of glycans achieves high-resolution separation of glycan mixtures
released from glycoproteins, including structurally similar isomers. While
there is some understanding of glycan separation on PGC, system-independent
retention values have not been established.
Using hydrolysed dextran as an internal standard, and
Skyline software for post-acquisition normalisation, retention time and glycan
peak area variation of replicate injections of glycan mixtures was
significantly reduced. Normalisation of retention time to the dextran ladder
allowed assignment of system-independent retention values, values that are
applicable to all PGC-based separations regardless of chromatographic system. We
have built a library of over 300 PGC-separated glycan structures with assigned normalised
glucose unit (GU) PGC retention values.
To further define the mechanism of glycan separation
with PGC, we identified predictive models for the chromatographic effects
resulting from addition and/or removal of core-fucosylation and bisecting GlcNAc
based on the PGC normalised retention time library. A dextran ladder spectral
library was also built to ensure correct retention time assignment of
the internal standard added to glycan mixtures. Using the spectral matching
feature in Skyline, isomeric discrimination between O-mannosylated glycans and the glucose-based dextran ladder was
achieved.
As a result, system-independent automated assignment of
glycan structure based on precursor mass and glucose unit value, using a glycan
structure reference library, can be achieved using PGC-LC-MS.</description><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_165b479e535:480db8:4c71e4fe</id><summary><content>Porous graphitised carbon (PGC) based chromatographic

Structures are defined in hierarchical trees in which subunits can be represented by geometric or atomic models. Repeating subunits can be docked into their assembly symmetries, describing their locations and orientations in space. The scattering amplitude of the entire structure can be calculated by computing the amplitudes of the basic subunits on 3D reciprocal-space grids, moving up in the hierarchy, calculating the RGs of the larger structures, and by repeating this process for all the leaves and nodes of the tree. For very large structures, a Hybrid method can be used to avoid numerical artifacts. In the Hybrid method, only grids of smaller subunits are summed and used as subunits in a direct computation of the scattering amplitude. D+ can accurately analyze both small- and wide-angle solution X-ray scattering data. We present how D+ applies the RG algorithm, accounts for rotations and translations of subunits, processes atomic models, accounts for the contribution of the solvent as well as the solvation layer of complex structures in a scalable manner, writes and accesses RGs, interpolates between grid points, computes numerical integrals, enables the use of scripts to define complicated structures, applies fitting algorithms, accounts for several coexisting uncorrelated populations, and accelerates computations using GPUs. D+ may also account for different X-ray energies to analyze anomalous solution X-ray scattering data. An accessory tool that can identify repeating subunits in a protein data bank (PDB) file of a complex structure is provided. The tool can compute the orientation and translation of repeating subunits needed for exploiting the advantages of the RG algorithm in D+. In addition, a python wrapper is also available, enabling more advanced computations and integration of D+ with other computational tools. Finally, we present a large number of tests and compare the results of D+ with other programs when possible and demonstrate the use of D+ to analyze solution scattering data from dynamic microtubule structures with different protofilament number.

D+ and its source code are freely available (https://scholars.huji.ac.il/uriraviv/software/d-software) for academic users and developers.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><fingerprint>fa761442</fingerprint></item><item><entities><item><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Antarctic</id><label>Antarctic</label><mentions><item><text>Antarctic</text></item></mentions></item><item><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/pd</id><label>PD</label><mentions><item><text>PD</text></item></mentions></item><item><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/lgm - pd δ δt surf</id><label>LGM - PD Δ δT surf</label><mentions><item><text>LGM - PD Δ δT surf</text></item><item><text>LGM</text></item><item><text>LGM - PD</text></item></mentions></item><item><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/wdc</id><label>WDC</label><mentions><item><text>WDC</text></item></mentions></item></entities><published>1535612400000</published><unread>True</unread><engagement>3</engagement><author><name>Martin Werner</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05430-y</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Reconciling glacial Antarctic water stable isotopes with ice sheet topography and the isotopic paleothermometer</title><crawled>1535619792373</crawled><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05430-y</originId><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/XZGM5uNVl80/s41467-018-05430-y</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reconciling glacial Antarctic water stable isotopes with ice sheet topography and the isotopic paleothermometer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reconciling glacial Antarctic water stable isotopes with ice sheet topography and the isotopic paleothermometer, Published online: 30 August 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05430-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05430-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Despite their importance, the accuracy of the quantitative interpretation of Antarctic ice core stable water isotope records remains a matter of debate.

Here we postulated that an artificial intelligence (AI) approach trained on thousands of embryos can reliably predict embryo quality without human intervention. To test this hypothesis, we implemented an AI approach based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Our approach called STORK accurately predicts the morphological quality of blastocysts based on raw digital images of embryos with 98% accuracy. These results indicate that a DNN can automatically and accurately grade embryos based on raw images. Using clinical data for 2,182 embryos, we then created a decision tree that integrates clinical parameters such as embryo quality and patient age to identify scenarios associated with increased or decreased pregnancy chance. This IVF data-driven analysis shows that the chance of pregnancy varies from 13.8% to 66.3%. In conclusion, our AI-driven approach provides a novel way to assess embryo quality and uncovers new, potentially personalized strategies to select embryos with an improved likelihood of pregnancy outcome.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16557b558be:86a6be1:4c71e4fe</id><content><content>Morphology assessment has become the standard method for evaluation of embryo quality and selecting human blastocysts for transfer in in-vitro fertilization (IVF).

The way it’s traditionally worked – for decades – has been that a company develops a drug, runs clinical trials, etc., puts together a (huge) data package and sends it off to the FDA. In the oldish days it all went off in hard copy – I remember a celebration when the 18-wheeler pulled out of the loading dock on its way to Maryland, loaded down with box after box of bound copies of the NDA and the associated data. If a company wanted approval for another indication, well, it did something similar: it went out and ran more trials, put a package together, and sent it to the FDA for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for a long time companies have been working with the agency to try to make this whole process go smoother. You would be well advised to consult with them about whether the trials you’re planning will generate (in their view) data that could be convincing enough for approval, and talk about endpoints and trial design. Some areas, naturally, have more clarity than others in these regards, but especially if you’re a pioneer in some area, you don’t want to just drop things on the regulators without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is moving to a new phase, as that link above shows. What if, in some therapeutic areas with well-worked-out clinical markers, the FDA didn’t actually wait on a complete formal application? What if they monitored trial data as it became available and approved things based on what the data indicate are approvable? That’s what’s starting to take place in oncology. Merck has received an approval for Keytruda in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which they’d been working on in the clinic, but this approval was a “real-time” one that moved faster than the traditional turn-taking mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/OCE/ucm612927.htm&quot;&gt;Here are the details&lt;/a&gt; from the FDA itself. They’re looking for drugs that are likely to show clear, substantial improvements over the standard of care, not borderline cases. And these need to be run in the clinic with “straightforward” study designs, nothing fancy, with highly relevant endpoints that can be easily determined – like overall survival in a cancer trial. Trials aimed at prevention, or at adjuvant effects and so on aren’t part of this yet. And interestingly, studies conducted exclusively outside the US are excluded from this pilot program entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes a lot of sense, and I think that the agency is taking a sensible approach by picking the “slam-dunk” type studies for these even-more-fast-tracked approvals. One thing to watch is whether the program gets diluted over time, as others try to move in and get some of the real-time-approval action. It’s fine if the FDA wants to expand it, but they should only expand it as other therapeutic areas and trials meet these standards – let them come up to this level rather than lowering the criteria to meet them. If I had to pick an area beyond oncology that I would expect to fit in to this system, it might be infectious disease. Those endpoints are pretty solid, and the existing standards of care are well-defined, so we’ll see if that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably won’t until the agency has evaluated this pilot oncology program, and they’re being deliberately vague about how long it’ll last and when they’ll do such an evaluation. Perhaps if it works really well there could be a real-time approval of real-time approval?&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>76b29b50</fingerprint><description>Here’s an example of the current regulatory framework – you may like it, you may not, but if you’re doing drug research you should know that it’s going on.

Formally, this is referred to as the 3D genome reconstruction problem (3D-GRP). None of the existing methods for solving the 3D-GRP have utilized a non-procedural programming approach (such as constraint programming or integer programming) despite the established advantages and successful applications of such approaches for predicting the 3D structure of other biomolecules. Our objective was to develop a set of mathematical models and corresponding non-procedural implementations for solving the 3D-GRP to realize the same advantages. Results: We present a set of non-procedural approaches for predicting 3D genome organization from Hi-C data (collectively referred to as SonHi-C and pronounced &amp;quot;sonic&amp;quot;). Specifically, this set is comprised of three mathematical models based on constraint programming (CP), graph matching (GM) and integer programming (IP). All of the mathematical models were implemented using non-procedural languages and tested with Hi-C data from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast). The CP implementation could not optimally solve the problem posed by the fission yeast data after several days of execution time. The GM and IP implementations were able to predict a 3D model of the fission yeast genome in 1.088 and 294.44 seconds, respectively. These 3D models were then biologically validated through literature search which verified that the predictions were able to recapitulate key documented features of the yeast genome. Conclusions: Overall, the mathematical models and programs developed here demonstrate the power of non-procedural programming and graph theoretic techniques for quickly and accurately modelling the 3D genome from Hi-C data.

It’s not surprising, in a way, because these are cells that have already (and unfortunately) proven themselves to be robust and fast-growing, so many of these lines tend to take to cell culture conditions pretty well. In the case of HeLa cells, too well – over the years, there have been more cases than you’d like to think about where HeLas have contaminated other cell lines and crowded them out without the the researchers involved noticing for a while. That doesn’t happen as often as it used to (cheaper sequencing and people in general being more aware of the problem), but it’s always out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’d imagine, these cells lines are very important in oncology drug development, being located way up near the top of the screening cascade. They’re used both to see if you’re affecting the sorts of tumors you hope to target, and to get some idea of selectivity across different types. Now, everyone knows that these lines don’t really reflect what’s going on in an actual tumor – it’s a different environment in general, and after cells have been in culture a while they tend to be different beasts than they were at the start – but it’s still a lot better than running no cell assay at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0409-3&quot;&gt;Here’s a new paper&lt;/a&gt;, though, that goes into detail about just how different those cells are, and not so much from the original tumor samples, as from &lt;em&gt;other batches of what are supposed to be the exact same cells&lt;/em&gt;. That’s not so good. Cancer cell lines tend to be genomically unstable in general, which is a problem, but here are the numbers for just how much of a problem that is. This team looked at 106 tumor cells lines and found that there’s a very large amount of heterogeneity in them when examined closely (deep sequencing, RNA-seq, cell painting assay, and more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our results show that established cancer cell lines, generally thought to be clonal, are in fact highly genetically heterogeneous. This heterogeneity results both from clonal dynamics (that is, changes in the abundance of pre-existing subclones) and from continuous instability (that is, the appearance of new genetic variants). Moreover, genetic heterogeneity leads to varying patterns of gene expression, which in turn result in differential drug sensitivity. These findings have a number of important implications. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, they took 27 different samples of what are all labeled “MCF7” cells (a widely used breast cancer derived line) and compared 321 known oncology compounds across them. &lt;em&gt;At least 75% of the compounds that showed strong inhibition of one MCF7 line were totally inactive against others&lt;/em&gt;. That’s going to confound experiments big-time, and this paper is a loud warning for people to be aware of this problem and to do something about it. On the flip side, this heterogeneity can be an opportunity to learn more about cancer cell biology and compound effects on it – but only if you’re aware that it exists!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1dc37ffb</fingerprint><description>There are a lot of cancer cell lines out there, and many of them get used a lot, too.

A mutated KRAS protein is frequently observed in human cancers. Traditionally, the oncogenic properties of KRAS missense mutants at position 12 (G12X) have been considered as equal. Here, by assessing the probabilities of occurrence of all &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; G12X mutations and KRAS dynamics we show that this assumption does not hold true. Instead, our findings revealed an outstanding mutational bias. We conducted a thorough mutational analysis of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; G12X mutations and assessed to what extent the observed mutation frequencies follow a random distribution. Unique tissue-specific frequencies are displayed with specific mutations, especially with G12R, which cannot be explained by random probabilities. To clarify the underlying causes for the nonrandom probabilities, we conducted extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (170 μs) to study the differences of G12X mutations on a molecular level. The simulations revealed an allosteric hydrophobic signaling network in KRAS, and that protein dynamics is altered among the G12X mutants and as such differs from the wild-type and is mutation-specific. The shift in long-timescale conformational dynamics was confirmed with Markov state modeling. A G12X mutation was found to modify KRAS dynamics in an allosteric way, which is especially manifested in the switch regions that are responsible for the effector protein binding. The findings provide a basis to understand better the oncogenic properties of KRAS G12X mutants and the consequences of the observed nonrandom frequencies of specific G12X mutations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wdtS34DOZ6k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165c4985a1e:12f2489:d987d511</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006458</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatu Pantsar, Sami Rissanen, Daniel Dauch, Tuomo Laitinen, Ilpo Vattulainen, Antti Poso&lt;/p&gt;

Studies of learning mechanisms critically depend on the ability to accurately assess learning outcomes. This assessment can be impeded by the often complex, multidimensional nature of behavior. We present a novel, automated approach to evaluating imitative learning. Conceptually, our approach estimates how much of the content present in a reference behavior is absent from the learned behavior. We validate our approach through examination of songbird vocalizations, complex learned behaviors the study of which has provided many insights into sensory-motor learning in general and vocal learning in particular. Historically, learning has been holistically assessed by human inspection or through comparison of specific song features selected by experimenters (e.g. fundamental frequency, spectral entropy). In contrast, our approach uses statistical models to broadly capture the structure of each song, and then estimates the divergence between the two models. We show that our measure of song learning (the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions corresponding to specific song data, or, Song &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;KL&lt;/sub&gt;) is well correlated with human evaluation of song learning. We then expand the analysis beyond learning and show that Song &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;KL&lt;/sub&gt; also detects the typical song deterioration that occurs following deafening. Finally, we illustrate how this measure can be extended to quantify differences in other complex behaviors such as human speech and handwriting. This approach potentially provides a framework for assessing learning across a broad range of behaviors like song that can be described as a set of discrete and repeated motor actions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YQeuwoUWgbQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165911180f6:4c470b:215b6325</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006437</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by David G.

Thus, building highly efficient &amp;quot;search engines&amp;quot; for protein databases is a highly desired function in protein bioinformatics. As of August 2018, there are more than 140,000 protein structures in PDB, and this number is still increasing rapidly. Such a big number introduces a big challenge for scanning the whole structure database with high speeds and high sensitivities at the same time. Unfortunately, classic sequence alignment tools and pairwise structure alignment tools are either not sensitive enough to remote homologous proteins (with low sequence identities) or not fast enough for the task. Therefore, specifically designed computational methods are required for quickly scanning structure databases for homologous proteins. Here, we propose a novel ContactLib-DNN method to quickly scan structure databases for homologous proteins. The core idea is to build structure fingerprints for proteins, and to perform alignment-free comparisons with the fingerprints. Specifically, the fingerprints are low-dimensional vectors representing the contact groups within the proteins. Notably, the Cartesian distance between two fingerprint vectors well matches the RMSD between the two corresponding contact groups. This is done by using RMSD as the domain knowledge to supervise the deep neural network learning. When comparing to existing methods, ContactLib-DNN achieves the highest average AUROC of 0.959. Moreover, the best candidate found by ContactLib-DNN has a probability of 70.0% to be a true positive. This is a significant improvement over 56.2%, the best result produced by existing methods.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165a28dd6e2:280628f:b99eedab</id><content><content>Finding homologous proteins is the indispensable first step in many protein biology studies.

classical many-body molecular dynamics (MB-MD) and normal mode (NM) calculations to obtain molecular level information on the spectroscopic signatures in the OH
stretching region for all seven of the known ordered crystalline ice phases. The classical
MB-MD spectra are shown to capture the important spectral features by comparing
with experimental Raman spectra. This motivates the use of the classical simulations
in understanding the spectral features of the various ordered ice phases in molecular
terms. This is achieved through NM analysis to first demonstrate that the MB-MD
spectra can be well recovered through the transition dipole moments and polarizability
tensors calculated from each NM. From the normal mode calculations, measures of the
amount of symmetric and antisymmetric stretching are calculated for each ice, as well
as an approximation of how localized each mode is. These metrics aid in viewing the
ice phases on a continuous spectrum determined by their density. As in ice Ih, it is
found that most of the other ordered ice phases have highly delocalized modes and
their spectral features cannot, in general, be described in terms of molecular normal
modes. The lone exception is ice VIII, the densest crystalline ice phase. Despite being
found only at high pressure, the symmetry index shows a clear separation of symmetric
and antisymmetric stretching modes giving rise to two distinct features.</description><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1658689e195:519794:4db7ac35</id><summary><content>We build on results from our previous investigation into ice Ih using a combination of

It is estimated that the Earth’s biocapacity is unable to meet current demands, which begs the question: is a sustainable future possible for both humans and the environment? The UN projects a human population of approximately 11 billion by the end of the 21st century; requiring additional agricultural land, greater demands for natural resources, and technological advancements. We model human population over the next century, emphasizing feedbacks between natural and agricultural resource availability and human demography. We argue that an intensive agriculture approach to feeding the growing population is ill-conceived, without considering biodiversity and ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient cycling, pollination, water purification, pest control). The productivity of agricultural land and human population dynamics are dependent on the area of natural land—generally, tipping at 5 billion ha of natural land (approximately 40% of the Earth’s terrestrial area). Furthermore, our model shows that an imprudent proactive approach (i.e., focusing on agriculture and ignoring ecosystem services) limits the success of reactive measures (i.e., restoration) in the future, while the inability to react to changes and recover natural systems leads to human population decline.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z66BhJkqos0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16548f7ddc2:151bc9:3da9d93</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006389</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kirsten Henderson, Michel Loreau&lt;/p&gt;

Many efforts have been made for early detection of melanoma. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) hosted the 2018 Challenges to help the diagnosis of melanoma based on dermoscopic images. In this paper, we describe our solutions for the task 2 of ISIC 2018 Challenges. We present two deep learning approaches to automatically detect lesion attributes of melanoma, one is a multi-task U-Net model and the other is a Mask R-CNN based model. Our multi-task U-Net model achieved a Jaccard index of 0.433 on official test data, which ranks the 5th place on the final leaderboard.

To address this issue, we developed a somatic mutation discovery approach based on machine learning that outperformed existing methods in identifying experimentally validated tumor alterations (sensitivity of 97% versus 90 to 99%; positive predictive value of 98% versus 34 to 92%). Analysis of paired tumor-normal exome data from 1368 TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) samples using this method revealed concordance for 74% of mutation calls but also identified likely false-positive and false-negative changes in TCGA data, including in clinically actionable genes. Determination of high-quality somatic mutation calls improved tumor mutation load–based predictions of clinical outcome for melanoma and lung cancer patients previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

These data are mostly stored as VCF-format files.

The SeqTailor webserver streamlines the sequence extraction process, and accelerates the analysis of genetic variant data with software requiring DNA or protein sequences.

A specialized feature of microbiome count data is the presence of a large number of zeros, which makes it difficult to analyze in case-control studies.

Results: The purpose of this article is to develop a new probabilistic model, called BERMUDA (BERnoulli and MUltinomial Distribution-based latent Allocation), to address these problems. BERMUDA enables us to describe the differences in bacteria composition and a certain disease among samples.

Understanding the epidemiology of seasonal influenza is critical for healthcare resource allocation and early detection of anomalous seasons. It can be challenging to obtain high-quality data of influenza cases specifically, as clinical presentations with influenza-like symptoms may instead be cases of one of a number of alternate respiratory viruses. We use a new dataset of confirmed influenza virological data from 2011-2016, along with high-quality denominators informing a hierarchical observation process, to model seasonal influenza dynamics in New South Wales, Australia. We use approximate Bayesian computation to estimate parameters in a climate-driven stochastic epidemic model, including the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the proportion of the population susceptible to the circulating strain at the beginning of the season, and the probability an infected individual seeks treatment. We conclude that &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and initial population susceptibility were strongly related, emphasising the challenges of identifying these parameters. Relatively high &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; values alongside low initial population susceptibility were among the results most consistent with these data. Our results reinforce the importance of distinguishing between &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the effective reproduction number (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) in modelling studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZAXthSm1MzA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16543d90645:a00850:d987d511</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006377</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert C.

Lost data can be an obstacle to downstream analyses that require complete data matrices. State-of-the-art imputation techniques including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based methods usually achieve good performances, but are computationally expensive especially for large datasets such as those involved in pan-cancer analysis. Results: This study describes a new method: a denoising autoencoder with partial loss (DAPL) as a deep learning based alternative for data imputation. Results on pan-cancer gene expression data and DNA methylation data from over 11,000 samples demonstrate significant improvement over standard denoising autoencoder for both data missing-at-random cases with a range of missing percentages, and missing-not-at-random cases based on expression level and GC-content. We discuss the advantages of DAPL over traditional imputation methods and show that it achieves comparable or better performance with less computational burden.

The molecular makeup of the offspring of a dividing cell gradually becomes phenotypically decorrelated from the parent cell by noise and regulatory mechanisms that amplify phenotypic heterogeneity. Such regulatory mechanisms form networks that contain thresholds between phenotypes. Populations of cells can be poised near the threshold so that a subset of the population probabilistically undergoes the phenotypic transition. We sought to characterize the diversity of bacterial populations around a growth-modulating threshold via analysis of the effect of non-genetic inheritance, similar to conditions that create antibiotic-tolerant persister cells and other examples of bet hedging. Using simulations and experimental lineage data in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, we present evidence that regulation of growth amplifies the dependence of growth arrest on cellular lineage, causing clusters of related cells undergo growth arrest in certain conditions. Our simulations predict that lineage correlations and the sensitivity of growth to changes in toxin levels coincide in a critical regime. Below the critical regime, the sizes of related growth arrested clusters are distributed exponentially, while in the critical regime clusters sizes are more likely to become large. Furthermore, phenotypic diversity can be nearly as high as possible near the critical regime, but for most parameter values it falls far below the theoretical limit. We conclude that lineage information is indispensable for understanding regulation of cellular growth.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fxo6jPZ5mP4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16562be74ac:544cd:3da9d93</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006380</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arnab Bandyopadhyay, Huijing Wang, J.

Co-expression networks can characterize the interactions among miRNAs. Differential correlation network is a powerful tool to investigate the differences of co-expression networks between cases and controls. To construct a differential correlation network, the Fisher&apos;s Z-transformation test is usually used. However, the Fisher&apos;s Z-transformation test requires the normality assumption, the violation of which would result in inflated Type I error rate. Several bootstrapping-based improvements for Fisher&apos;s Z test have been proposed. However, these methods are too computationally intensive to be used to construct differential correlation networks for high-throughput genomic data. In this article, we proposed six novel robust equal-correlation tests that are computationally efficient.

Differential correlation network is a powerful tool to investigate the differences of co-expression networks between cases and controls. To construct a differential correlation network, the Fisher&apos;s Z-transformation test is usually used. However, the Fisher&apos;s Z-transformation test requires the normality assumption, the violation of which would result in inflated Type I error rate. Several bootstrapping-based improvements for Fisher&apos;s Z test have been proposed. However, these methods are too computationally intensive to be used to construct differential correlation networks for high-throughput genomic data. In this article, we proposed six novel robust equal-correlation tests that are computationally efficient. The systematic simulation studies and a real microRNA data analysis showed that one of the six proposed tests (ST5) overall performed better than other methods.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b07f29a5</fingerprint><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6403/672.full</canonicalUrl><published>1534441235000</published><unread>True</unread><engagement>126</engagement><author><name>Aguilar, J., Monaenkova, D., Linevich, V., Savoie, W., Dutta, B., Kuan, H.- S., Betterton, M.

Oscillatory activity robustly correlates with task demands during many cognitive tasks. However, not only are the network mechanisms underlying the generation of these rhythms poorly understood, but it is also still unknown to what extent they may play a functional role, as opposed to being a mere epiphenomenon. Here we study the mechanisms underlying the influence of oscillatory drive on network dynamics related to cognitive processing in simple working memory (WM), and memory recall tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the frequency of oscillatory input interacts with the intrinsic dynamics in networks of recurrently coupled spiking neurons to cause changes of state: the neuronal correlates of the corresponding cognitive process. We find that slow oscillations, in the delta and theta band, are effective in activating network states associated with memory recall. On the other hand, faster oscillations, in the beta range, can serve to clear memory states by resonantly driving transient bouts of spike synchrony which destabilize the activity. We leverage a recently derived set of exact mean-field equations for networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons to systematically study the bifurcation structure in the periodically forced spiking network. Interestingly, we find that the oscillatory signals which are most effective in allowing flexible switching between network states are not smooth, pure sinusoids, but rather burst-like, with a sharp onset. We show that such periodic bursts themselves readily arise spontaneously in networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and that the burst frequency can be tuned via changes in tonic drive. Finally, we show that oscillations in the gamma range can actually stabilize WM states which otherwise would not persist.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bbt9ElVGJQM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165afee6594:277f844:d987d511</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006430</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Helmut Schmidt, Daniele Avitabile, Ernest Montbrió, Alex Roxin&lt;/p&gt;

The gene lists need to be further analyzed to identify overrepresented genes and functions in order to guide downstream analyses. Currently available gene enrichment tools rely on functional classifications based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A shortcoming of the GO-based classification system is that the GO terms are broad and often redundant, hence necessitating alternate approaches. Results: We propose a robust functional enrichment approach, GenFam, to classify as well as enrich overrepresented gene functions, based on gene family categories. GenFam offers a unique approach to mine valuable, biologically-relevant information, beyond the conventional GO term based enrichment. GenFam is available as a web-based, graphical-user interface, which allows users to readily input gene lists, and export results in both tabular and graphical formats. Additionally, users can customize analysis parameters, by choosing from the different significance tests to conduct advanced statistics. Currently, GenFam supports gene family classification and enrichment analyses for seventy-eight plant genomes. Conclusions: GenFam implements a unique approach to classify and interpret enriched biological information in terms of gene families from user input of differentially expressed gene datasets.

catalyst containing the dominant M1 phase, recently proposed as active and selective in this
selective ammoxidation reaction. The reaction kinetics was studied in a tubular quartz reactor at
600-700K operated in both differential and integral regimes at 5-60% propane conversion. The
results obtained in this study were examined on the basis of two reaction networks involving
propane transformation via (1) parallel routes to propylene, acrylonitrile and carbon oxides and
(2) propylene as the reaction intermediate for acrylonitrile. The results obtained indicated only a
slight preference for the reaction network involving the propylene intermediate, which may be
explained on the basis of catalytic behavior of the M1 and M2 phases present in the
hydrothermal Mo-V-Nb-Te-O catalyst. The dominant M1 phase was capable of catalyzing all of
the above transformation steps, whereas the M2 impurity phase was only active in propylene
ammoxidation to acrylonitrile. The contribution of the M2 phase to propylene ammoxidation is
expected to be less significant at industrially relevant high propane conversions because of the
improved ability of the M1 phase to covert propylene into acrylonitrile at longer residence times.</description><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1659fdb6b1b:250d056:4c71e4fe</id><summary><content>We investigated propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile over hydrothermal Mo-V-Nb-TeO

blocks is a key problem to many hypotheses on the origin of life. Much has been achieved in understanding how the
building blocks of biopolymers may be formed, and in understanding how
macromolecules may produce functional and increasingly life-like systems. How these steps can be joined, and how defined populations of macromolecules can form from mixtures of simple building blocks, instead of an undifferentiated
mess, remain open questions. Herein, we show how unconstrained condensation reactions of both amino acids, and prebiotic soup mixtures
produced by spark discharge, can be steered by changes in the reaction environment, such as order
of reactant addition (mixing history), and addition of salts or minerals. Using
techniques akin to
untargeted metabolomics
to survey product distributions we demonstrate that while these reactions do produce a large range of
species, there are distinct, significant, and reproducible differences between the
product ensembles.
Furthermore, we observe that differences in composition are demonstrated through clearly different structural and functional properties. Using this approach, we
demonstrate for the first time that simple variations in environmental
parameters can mediate the differentiation of distinct ensembles from both
amino acid mixtures and a classic primordial soup model (products of a ‘Miller
Urey’ type spark discharge reaction). This shows that the
synthetic complexity produced by such unconstrained reactions is not as
intractable as often suggested, when viewed through a chemically agnostic lens.
An open approach
to complexity can generate compositional, structural, and functional diversity
from fixed sets of simple starting materials, suggesting that differentiation
of product mixtures can occur in the wider environment without the need for
biological machinery.</description><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16538fb216c:6125220:6f86c10b</id><summary><content>Harnessing and then controlling combinatorial explosions in uncontrolled condensation reactions of simple building

In this work, we develop a general analysis tool to quantitatively study the spatial correlations of gene expression in fixed tissue sections. As an illustration, we analyze the spatial distribution of single mRNA molecules measured by in situ sequencing on human fetal pancreas at three developmental time points 80, 87 and 117 days post-fertilization. We develop a density profile-based method to capture the spatial relationship between gene expression and other morphological features of the tissue sample such as position of nuclei and endocrine cells of the pancreas. In addition, we build a statistical model to characterize correlations in the spatial distribution of the expression level among different genes. This model enables us to infer the inhibitory and clustering effects throughout different time points.

In Bangladesh, the poultry industry is an economically and socially important sector, but it is persistently threatened by the effects of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza. Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. In particular, we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, across multiple settings the top performing control action amongst those under consideration were targeted proactive surveillance schemes. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its intensity, that could potentially be applied in the event of a developing outbreak of H5N1 amongst originally H5N1 virus-free commercially-reared poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZiihqPruFqU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165d4221454:db03e4:6f86c10b</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006439</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Edward M.

However, the progress has been largely hindered by the lack of a highly efficient and accurate tool that is fast enough to find not only the target motifs, but also cooperative motifs contained in very large ChIP-seq datasets with a binding peak length of typical enhancers (~1,000 bp). To circumvent this hurdle, we herein present an ultra-fast and highly accurate motif-finding algorithm, ProSampler, with automatic motif length detection. ProSampler first identifies significant k-mers in the dataset and combines highly similar significant k-mers to form preliminary motifs. ProSampler then merges preliminary motifs with subtle similarity using a novel graph-based Gibbs sampler to find core motifs. Finally, ProSampler extends the core motifs by applying a two-proportion z-test to the flanking positions to identify motifs longer than k. As the number of preliminary motifs is much smaller than that of k-mers in a dataset, we greatly reduce the search space of the Gibbs sampler compared with conventional ones. By storing flanking sequences in a hash table, we avoid extensive IO and the necessity of examining all lengths of motifs in an interval. When evaluated on both synthetic and real ChIP-seq datasets, ProSampler runs orders of magnitude faster than the fastest existing tools while more accurately discovering primary motifs as well as cooperative motifs than do the best existing tools. Using ProSampler, we revealed previously unknown complex motif occurrence patterns in large ChIP-seq datasets, thereby providing insights into the mechanisms of cooperative TF binding for gene transcriptional regulation. Therefore, by allowing fast and accurate mining of the entire ChIP-seq datasets, ProSampler can greatly facilitate the efforts to identify the entire cis-regulatory code in genomes.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165476a8861:75b67c5:6f86c10b</id><content><content>The availability of a large volume of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets for various transcription factors (TF) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify all functional TF binding motifs clustered in the enhancers in genomes.

Combinatorial effects of epigenetic modifications on transcription activity have been proposed as “histone codes”. However, it is unclear whether there also exist inter-nucleosomal communications among epigenetic modifications at single nucleosome level, and if so, what functional roles they play. Meanwhile, how clear nucleosome patterns, such as nucleosome phasing and depletion, are formed at functional regions remains an intriguing enigma. To address these questions, we developed a Bayesian network model for interactions among different histone modifications across neighboring nucleosomes, based on the framework of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). From this model, we found that robust inter-nucleosomal interactions exist around transcription start site (TSS), transcription termination sites (TTS) or around CTCF binding sites; and these inter-nucleosomal interactions are often involved in transcription regulation. In addition to these general principles, DBN also uncovered a novel specific epigenetic interaction between H2A.Z and H4K20me1 on neighboring nucleosomes, involved in nucleosome free region (NFR) and nucleosome phasing establishment or maintenance. The level of negative correlation between neighboring H2A.Z and H4K20me1 strongly correlate with the size of NFR and the strength of nucleosome phasing around TSS. Our study revealed inter-nucleosomal communications as important players in signal propagation, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dbMl2WeMTC0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_165afee6594:277f843:d987d511</id><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006416</href></item></canonical><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Weizhong Chen, Yi Liu, Shanshan Zhu, Guoyu Chen, Jing-Dong J.

Two main factors affect the utility of potential prediction tools: their accuracy must enable extraction of reliable structural information on the proteins of interest, and their runtime must be low to keep pace with sequencing data being generated at a constantly increasing speed. Here, we present an updated and extended version of the NetSurfP tool (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetSurfP-2.0/), that can predict the most important local structural features with unprecedented accuracy and runtime. NetSurfP-2.0 is sequence-based and uses an architecture composed of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks trained on solved protein structures. Using a single integrated model, NetSurfP-2.0 predicts solvent accessibility, secondary structure, structural disorder, and backbone dihedral angles for each residue of the input sequences. We assessed the accuracy of NetSurfP-2.0 on several independent test datasets and found it to consistently produce state-of-the-art predictions for each of its output features. We observe a correlation of 80% between predictions and experimental data for solvent accessibility, and a precision of 85% on secondary structure 3-class predictions. In addition to improved accuracy, the processing time has been optimized to allow predicting more than 1,000 proteins in less than 2 hours, and complete proteomes in less than 1 day.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165c4be7129:1936898:cf41b655</id><content><content>The ability to predict local structural features of a protein from the primary sequence is of paramount importance for unravelling its function in absence of experimental structural information.

In addition to improved accuracy, the processing time has been optimized to allow predicting more than 1,000 proteins in less than 2 hours, and complete proteomes in less than 1 day.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>cfc2da9d</fingerprint></item><item><entities><item><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/China</id><label>China</label><mentions><item><text>China</text></item><item><text>Chinese</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/ma</id><label>MA</label><mentions><item><text>MA</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/supplementary fig</id><label>Supplementary Fig</label><mentions><item><text>Supplementary Fig</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Single-nucleotide polymorphism</id><label>Single-nucleotide polymorphism</label><mentions><item><text>SNPs</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/hardy</id><label>Hardy</label><mentions><item><text>Hardy</text></item></mentions><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><published>1536649200000</published><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Jiang Chang</name></author><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06136-x</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl></origin><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Exome-wide analysis identifies three low-frequency missense variants associated with pancreatic cancer risk in Chinese populations</title><crawled>1536658147940</crawled><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06136-x</originId><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/XFZM_b22QQc/s41467-018-06136-x</href></item></alternate><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exome-wide analysis identifies three low-frequency missense variants associated with pancreatic cancer risk in Chinese populations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exome-wide analysis identifies three low-frequency missense variants associated with pancreatic cancer risk in Chinese populations, Published online: 11 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06136-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06136-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a lethal human cancer with a poor 5-year overall survival rate.
