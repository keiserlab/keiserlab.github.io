Genomic prediction exploits single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome for predicting genetic merit of selection candidates. In most models for genomic prediction, e.g. BayesA, B, C, R and GBLUP, independence of SNP effects is assumed. However, SNP effects are expected to be locally dependent given the presence of a nearby QTL because SNPs surrounding the QTL do not segregate independently. A consequence of ignoring this dependence is that SNPs with small effects may be overly shrunk, e.g. effects from markers with high minor allele frequencies (MAF) that flank QTL with low MAF. A nested mixture model (BayesN) is developed to account for the dependence of effects of SNPs that are closely linked, where the effects of SNPs in every non-overlapping genomic window &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; follow a point mass at zero for all SNPs or a mixture of some SNPs with nonzero effects and others with zero effects. It can be regarded as a parsimonious alternative to the existing antedependence model, antiBayesB, which allow a nonstationary dependence of SNP effects. Illumina 777K BovineHD genotypes from 948 Angus cattle were used to simulate 5,000 offspring, with 4,000 used for training and 1,000 for validation. Scenarios with 300 common (MAF &gt; 0.05) or rare (MAF &amp;lt; 0.05) QTL randomly selected from segregating SNPs were replicated 8 times. SNPs corresponding to QTL were masked from a 600k panel comprising SNPs with MAF &gt; 0.05 or a 50k evenly spaced subset of these. Compared with BayesB and a modified antiBayesB, BayesN improved the accuracy of prediction up to 2.0% with 50k SNPs and up to 7.0% with 600k SNPs, most improvements occurring in the rare QTL scenario. Computing time was reduced up to 60% with 50k SNPs and up to 75% with 600k SNPs. BayesN is an accurate and computationally efficient method for genomic prediction with whole-genome SNPs, especially for traits with rare QTL.</content></content><author><name>Jian Zeng</name></author><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zeng, Dorian Garrick, Jack Dekkers, Rohan Fernando&lt;/p&gt;

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-1 family with multiple context dependent functions. We and others have shown that HIV infection is accompanied by increased circulating levels of IL-18 along with decreased levels of its antagonist, Interleukin-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP). The infection is also accompanied by intestinal inflammation and decreased intestinal integrity as measured by intestinal permeability, regeneration and repair. However, little is known concerning the relation between high level of IL-18 associated with the viral infection and intestinal permeability. Here we demonstrate that HIV treatment increases production of IL-18 and decreases that of IL-18BP production in human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. IL-18 causes apoptosis of the IEC by activating caspase-1 and caspase-3. It induces epithelial barrier hyperpermeability by decreasing and disrupting both tight and adherens junction proteins, occludin, claudin 2 and beta-catenin. Disorganization of F-actin was also observed in the IEC that were exposed to the cytokine. Moreover IL-18 decreases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Caco-2 and increases permeability in HT29 monolayers. The cells’ treatment with IL-18 causes an increase in the expression of phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light-chain (p-MLC) and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and a decrease in phosphorylated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (p-STAT)-5. This increase in p-MLC is suppressed by a Rho-kinase (ROCK)-specific inhibitor. Interestingly, the levels of the cytokine correlate with those of LPS in the circulation in three different categories of HIV infected patients (HAART-naïve and HAART-treated HIV-infected individuals, and Elite controls) as well as in healthy controls. Collectively, these results suggest that the HIV-induced IL-18 plays a role in increased intestinal permeability and microbial translocation observed in HIV-infected individuals.</content></content><author><name>Ossama Allam</name></author><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ossama Allam, Suzanne Samarani, Vikram Mehraj, Mohammad-Ali Jenabian, Cecile Tremblay, Jean-Pierre Routy, Devendra Amre, Ali Ahmad&lt;/p&gt;

Collectively, these results suggest that the HIV-induced IL-18 plays a role in increased intestinal permeability and microbial translocation observed in HIV-infected individuals.</description></item><item><engagement>28</engagement><title>Engineered promoters enable constant gene expression at any copy number in bacteria</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4111</link><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_1623ecd8351:26fb6b7:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nbt.4111-F1.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>282</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4111</originId><published>1521442800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1af2cc24</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4111</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engineered promoters enable constant gene expression at any copy number in bacteria&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineered promoters enable constant gene expression at any copy number in bacteria, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4111&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A series of feedforward-stabilized bacterial gene promoters produce near-identical expression levels regardless of copy number changes due to altered genetic context, strain or growth conditions.</content></content><author><name>Thomas H Segall-Shapiro</name></author><crawled>1521472078673</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engineered promoters enable constant gene expression at any copy number in bacteria&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineered promoters enable constant gene expression at any copy number in bacteria, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4111&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A series of feedforward-stabilized bacterial gene promoters produce near-identical expression levels regardless of copy number changes due to altered genetic context, strain or growth conditions.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Development and Application of Yeast and Phage Display of Diverse Lanthipeptides</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00581</link><id>1TYkl+7D2jbCAjv6kqe9qy39+K76tsp7YKV/mQVt7ps=_1626cb5a10a:269c69:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00581/20180319/images/medium/oc-2017-005814_0007.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>286</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00581</originId><crawled>1522242265354</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>ACS Central Science: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acscii</streamId></origin><fingerprint>57ff3050</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acscii/0/acscii.ahead-of-print/acscentsci.7b00581/20180319/images/medium/oc-2017-005814_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.7b00581&lt;/div&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00581</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Kenton J.

The present research addresses the question of whether regulatory-mode orientations affect self-forgiveness. We expected that people with a strong locomotion orientation would be more inclined to self-forgiveness because of their tendencies toward movement and change, which focus them on the future, whereas people with a strong assessment orientation would refrain from self-forgiveness due to their evaluative tendencies which focus them on the past. These hypotheses were supported by the results in four studies that tested the relation between regulatory modes and self-forgiveness by measuring (Studies 1, 3 and 4) and manipulating (Study 2) regulatory-mode-orientations. Finally, in Study 4 we examined more closely our hypothesis that the relation between self-forgiveness and regulatory modes is mediated by past and future temporal foci. The implications of the results for regulatory mode theory are also discussed.</content></content><author><name>Antonio Pierro</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Pierro, Gennaro Pica, Anna Maria Giannini, E.

The structure and function of clinical dosage insulin and its analogues were assessed. This included ‘native insulins’ (human recombinant, bovine, porcine), ‘fast-acting analogues’ (aspart, glulisine, lispro) and ‘slow-acting analogues’ (glargine, detemir, degludec). Analytical ultracentrifugation, both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments, were employed to yield distributions of both molar mass and sedimentation coefficient of all nine insulins. Size exclusion chromatography, coupled to multi-angle light scattering, was also used to explore the function of these analogues. On ultracentrifugation analysis, the insulins under investigation were found to be in numerous conformational states, however the majority of insulins were present in a primarily hexameric conformation. This was true for all native insulins and two fast-acting analogues. However, glargine was present as a dimer, detemir was a multi-hexameric system, degludec was a dodecamer (di-hexamer) and glulisine was present as a dimer-hexamer-dihexamer system. However, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the two hexameric fast-acting analogues (aspart and lispro) dissociated into monomers and dimers due to the lack of zinc in the mobile phase. This comprehensive study is the first time all nine insulins have been characterised in this way, the first time that insulin detemir have been studied using analytical ultracentrifugation and the first time that insulins aspart and glulisine have been studied using sedimentation equilibrium. The structure and function of these clinically administered insulins is of critical importance and this research adds novel data to an otherwise complex functional physiological protein.</content></content><author><name>Gary G.

The structure and function of these clinically administered insulins is of critical importance and this research adds novel data to an otherwise complex functional physiological protein.</description></item><item><engagement>23</engagement><title>SciLine scores successes in first five months of operation</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1479-a?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c83:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1479.1.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1479-a?rss=1</originId><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e2511d79</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1479-a?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jarvis, M.</name></author><published>1522345097000</published></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23593-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>LentiPro26: novel stable cell lines for constitutive lentiviral vector production</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23593-y</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16266d0d910:5f99c85:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23593-y/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23593_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>602</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23593-y</originId><published>1522134000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bd934b74</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/iFCtILSAZWg/s41598-018-23593-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LentiPro26: novel stable cell lines for constitutive lentiviral vector production&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LentiPro26: novel stable cell lines for constitutive lentiviral vector production, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23593-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23593-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;LentiPro26: novel stable cell lines for constitutive lentiviral vector production&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/iFCtILSAZWg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>H.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the range, nature, and extent of current research activity exploring the influence of innovative health-related technologies on social inequalities in health, with specific focus on a deeper understanding of the variables used to measure this connection and the pathways leading to the (re)production of inequalities. A review process was conducted, based on scoping review techniques, searching literature published from January 1, 1996 to November 25, 2016 using MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Search, sorting, and data extraction processes were conducted by a team of researchers and experts using a dynamic, reflexive examination process. Of 4139 studies collected from the search process, a total of 33 were included in the final analysis. Results of this study include the classification of technologies based on how these technologies are accessed and used by end users. In addition to the factors and mechanisms that influence unequal &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to technologies, the results of this study highlight the importance of variations in &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; that importantly shape social inequalities in health. Additionally, focus on health care services technologies must be accompanied by investigating emerging technologies influencing healthy lifestyle, genomics, and personalized devices in health. Findings also suggest that choosing one measure of social position over another has important implications for the interpretation of research results. Furthermore, understanding the pathways through which various innovative health technologies reduce or (re)produce social inequalities in health is context dependent. In order to better understand social inequalities in health, these contextual variations draw attention to the need for critical distinctions between technologies based on how these various technologies are accessed and used. The results of this study provide a comprehensive starting point for future research to further investigate how innovative technologies may influence the unequal distribution of health as a human right.</content></content><author><name>Daniel Weiss</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Weiss, Håvard T.

Protein trafficking within cilia is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery composed of large protein complexes. The BBSome consists of eight BBS proteins encoded by causative genes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and has been implicated in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by connecting the IFT machinery to cargo GPCRs. Membrane recruitment of the BBSome to promote cargo trafficking has been proposed to be regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase ARL6/BBS3, through its interaction with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome. We here investigated how the BBSome core subcomplex composed of BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 assembles and interacts with ARL6, and found that the ARL6–BBS1 interaction is reinforced by BBS9. &lt;i&gt;BBS1&lt;/i&gt;-knockout (KO) cells showed defects in the ciliary entry of other BBSome subunits and ARL6, and in ciliary retrograde trafficking and the export of the GPCRs, Smoothened and GPR161. The trafficking defect of these GPCRs was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type BBS1, but not by its mutant lacking BBS9-binding ability. Our data thus indicate that the intact BBSome is required for retrograde trafficking of GPCRs out of cilia.</content></content><author><name>Shohei Nozaki</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shohei Nozaki, Yohei Katoh, Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuhisa Nakayama&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We examine to what extent the effect of early-life conditions (health and socioeconomic status) on health in later life is mediated by educational attainment and life-course trajectories (fertility, partnership, employment).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 12,034), we apply, separately by gender, multichannel sequence analysis and cluster analysis to obtain groups of similar family and employment histories. The KHB method is used to disentangle direct and indirect effects of early-life conditions on health.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Early-life-conditions indirectly impact on health in later life as result of their influence on education and family and employment trajectories. For example, between 22% and 42% of the effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Even higher percentages are found for men (35% - 57%). On the contrary, the positive effect of poor health at childhood on poor health at older ages is not significantly mediated by education and life-course trajectories. Education captures most of the mediating effect of parental socio-economic status. More specifically, between 66% and 75% of the indirect effect of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Again, higher percentages are found for men (86% - 93%). Early-life conditions, especially socioeconomic status, influence family and employment trajectories indirectly through their impact on education. We also find a persistent direct impact of early-life conditions on health at older ages.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate that early-life experiences influence education and life-course trajectories and health in later life, suggesting that public investments in children are expected to produce long lasting effects on people’s lives throughout the different phases of their life-course.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Bruno Arpino</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Arpino, Jordi Gumà, Albert Julià&lt;/p&gt;

The signaling scaffold protein GIT1 is expressed widely throughout the brain, but its function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remains elusive. Mice lacking GIT1 have been proposed as a model for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, due to alterations in basal locomotor activity as well as paradoxical locomotor suppression by the psychostimulant amphetamine. Since we had previously shown that GIT1-knockout mice have normal locomotor activity, here we examined GIT1-deficient mice for ADHD-like behavior in more detail, and find neither hyperactivity nor amphetamine-induced locomotor suppression. Instead, GIT1-deficient mice exhibit profound learning and memory defects and reduced synaptic structural plasticity, consistent with an intellectual disability phenotype. We conclude that loss of GIT1 alone is insufficient to drive a robust ADHD phenotype in distinct strains of mice. In contrast, multiple learning and memory defects have been observed here and in other studies using distinct GIT1-knockout lines, consistent with a predominant intellectual disability phenotype related to altered synaptic structural plasticity.</content></content><author><name>Amanda C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected (HIV+) persons have elevated risks for various manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD). No studies to our knowledge have compared atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) prevalence and associated characteristics for HIV+ persons and matched uninfected controls.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Persons with diagnoses of HIV receiving care at a large urban academic medical center were frequency-matched 1:2 on age, sex, race, zip code, and clinic location with uninfected persons. Possible AF/AFL was screened for using administrative codes and diagnoses of AF/AFL were subsequently adjudicated using electrocardiography and physician notes; adjudication was performed given the inconsistent validity of administrative code-derived AF diagnoses found in previous studies. There were 101 confirmed AF/AFL cases (2.00%) among 5,052 HIV+ patients and 159 confirmed AF/AFL cases (1.57%) among 10,121 uninfected controls [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.99–1.64; p = 0.056]. The association between HIV serostatus and AF/AFL was attenuated after adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors. Among HIV+ persons, nadir CD4+ T cell count &amp;lt;200 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was associated with approximately twofold elevated odds of AF/AFL even after adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors (Multivariable-adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.21–3.25). There was no significant association between log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; of peak HIV viral load and AF/AFL (Multivariable-adjusted OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86–1.24). Older age, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with similarly elevated odds of AF/AFL for HIV+ persons and uninfected controls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;HIV-related immunosuppression (nadir CD4 T cell count &amp;lt;200 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and traditional CVD risk factors are associated with significantly elevated odds of AF/AFL among HIV+ persons.

Immune-compromised mouse models allow for testing the preclinical efficacy of human cell transplantations and gene therapy strategies before moving forward to clinical trials. However, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of the &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sh&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;sh&lt;/sup&gt; mouse strain to create an immune-compromised model lacking function of &lt;i&gt;Rag2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Il2rγ&lt;/i&gt; led to unexpected morbidity and mortality. This warranted an investigation to ascertain the cause and predisposing factors associated with the outbreak. Postmortem examination was performed on 15 moribund mice. The main lesions observed in these mice consisted of ascending urogenital tract infections, suppurative otitis media, pneumonia, myocarditis, and meningoencephalomyelitis. As &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains harboring polyketide synthase (&lt;i&gt;pks)&lt;/i&gt; genomic island were recently isolated from laboratory mice, the tissue sections from the urogenital tract, heart, and middle ear were subjected to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; specific PNA-FISH assay that revealed discrete colonies of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; associated with the lesions. Microbiological examination and 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. coli-induced infection and septicemia in the affected mice. Further characterization by &lt;i&gt;clb&lt;/i&gt; gene analysis and colibactin toxicity assays of the &lt;i&gt;pks+ E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; revealed colibactin-associated cytotoxicity.

Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective.

Past and contemporary human actions are causing numerous changes in patterns and processes at various ecosystem scales and trophic levels, including unintended downstream changes, such as species interactions. In its native range &lt;i&gt;Acca sellowiana&lt;/i&gt; (Feijoa) combines some characteristics of human interactions: incipient domestication, restricted to subtropical Atlantic Forest highlands, associated with the threatened conifer &lt;i&gt;Araucaria angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Araucaria), within a domesticated landscape with anthropogenic forest patches, and provides fruit at a time of resource shortage (Araucaria seeds—&lt;i&gt;pinhão&lt;/i&gt;). We quantify the trophic relationships between Feijoa and vertebrates, and evaluate the influences on interactions caused by environmental variations, Feijoa domestication evidences, spatial distance and fruit availability. In four sites within protected areas, we selected 28 focal individuals of Feijoa (seven/site) and collected three temporal replicas between 2015 and 2016, when we measured productivity and frugivory via 45-second videos taken with camera traps. Using ecological network, rarefaction curves and variation partitioning analyses, we evaluate the frugivory network topology, the spatiotemporal structure of communities in relation to fruit availability and the influence of predictive variables on frugivory. We found a large spatiotemporal variation in productivity of Feijoa and that 20 species consumed Feijoa fruits, with a species degree of 2.8 (±5.7) and average Feijoa degree of 14.4 (±10.1), in a modular network with intermediary connectance. Rarefaction curves showed that richness and the independent records are congruent with the fruit amount. Variation partitioning showed that, for the focal individuals, canopy area, green coverage, patch size and distance to water influenced frugivory, and the Feijoa domestication influenced significantly the mammalian frugivory. Feijoa is an important resource that provides food during the time of year when &lt;i&gt;Pinhão&lt;/i&gt; is absent, and attracts frugivores, maintain the residual diversity of vertebrates contributing to the structure of communities in highlands. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the interactions between vertebrates and an incipient domesticated tree, in a cultural landscape and highly threatened environment, under a basal foodweb approach with implications for bottom-up and top-down forces. The results contribute to understanding animal-plant relationships, including concepts that can be replicated for other sessile prey and mobile predators in any region or habitat under different gradients of management.

Seizure clustering is a common and significant phenomenon in patients with epilepsy. The clustering of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) in animal models of epilepsy, including mouse pilocarpine models, has been reported. However, most studies have analyzed seizures for a short duration after the induction of status epilepticus (SE). In this study, we investigated the detailed characteristics of seizure clustering in the chronic stage of a mouse pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model for an extended duration by continuous 24/7 video-EEG monitoring. A seizure cluster was defined as the occurrence of one or more seizures per day for at least three consecutive days and at least five seizures during the cluster period. We analyzed the cluster duration, seizure-free period, cluster interval, and numbers of seizures within and outside the seizure clusters. The video-EEG monitoring began 84.5±33.7 days after the induction of SE and continued for 53.7±20.4 days. Every mouse displayed seizure clusters, and 97.0% of the seizures occurred within a cluster period. The seizure clusters were followed by long seizure-free periods of 16.3±6.8 days, showing a cyclic pattern. The SRSs also occurred in a grouped pattern within a day. We demonstrate that almost all seizures occur in clusters with a cyclic pattern in the chronic stage of a mouse pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. The seizure-free periods between clusters were long. These findings should be considered when performing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies using this animal model. Furthermore, this model might be appropriate for studying the unrevealed mechanism of ictogenesis.</content></content><author><name>Jung-Ah Lim</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jung-Ah Lim, Jangsup Moon, Tae-Joon Kim, Jin-Sun Jun, Byeongsu Park, Jung-Ick Byun, Jun-Sang Sunwoo, Kyung-Il Park, Soon-Tae Lee, Keun-Hwa Jung, Ki-Young Jung, Manho Kim, Daejong Jeon, Kon Chu, Sang Kun Lee&lt;/p&gt;

While there is substantial evidence that adults who violate gender stereotypes often face backlash (i.e. social and economic penalties), less is known about the nature of gender stereotypes for young children, and the penalties that children may face for violating them. We conducted three experiments, with over 2000 adults from the US, to better understand the content and consequences of adults’ gender stereotypes for young children. In Experiment 1, we tested which characteristics adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 635) believed to be descriptive (i.e. typical), prescriptive (i.e. required), and proscriptive (i.e. forbidden) for preschool-aged boys and girls. Using the characteristics that were rated in Experiment 1, we then constructed vignettes that were either ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’, and manipulated whether the vignettes were said to describe a boy or a girl. Experiment 2 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 697) revealed that adults rated stereotype-violating children as less likeable than their stereotype-conforming peers, and that this difference was more robust for boys than girls. Experiment 3 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 731) was a direct replication of Experiment 2, and revealed converging evidence of backlash against stereotype-violating children. In sum, our results suggest that even young children encounter backlash from adults for stereotype violations, and that these effects may be strongest for boys.</content></content><author><name>Jessica Sullivan</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Sullivan, Corinne Moss-Racusin, Michael Lopez, Katherine Williams&lt;/p&gt;

In sum, our results suggest that even young children encounter backlash from adults for stereotype violations, and that these effects may be strongest for boys.</description></item><item><engagement>4</engagement><title>What&apos;s in a name?</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1472?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c8a:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1472.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1472?rss=1</originId><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6e399bfe</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1472?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Goldsmith, G.

We sought to measure the response of cortisol concentrations around a professional tennis match and its association with hydration status and neuromuscular performance. Nine professional male tennis players were tested in a rest day, and 2-week after, during the first match of a professional tournament played in a clay-court. Salivary concentrations of cortisol (SalCC) were measured in a resting day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm), at the match day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm) and immediately before and after the match. Hydration status was assessed before the match (urine specific gravity; USG) while fluid turnover was tracked during the match. Finally, counter movement jump (CMJ) and handgrip isometric strength (HS) were measured before and after the match. SalCC, either in the morning (P = 0.161) and afternoon (P = 0.683) was similar in rest and match days. However, SalCC increased after the match (P = 0.033). Participants started the match hypohydrated (USG = 1.026±0.002) and during the match lost 1.0±0.3% of body weight despite 1.035±0.124 L/h of fluid ingested. CMJ and HS did not change post-match (P = 0.210 and P = 0.881, respectively). Correlations between the elevations in SalCC and dehydration (% BW loss) during the match were significant (r = -0.632; P = 0.034). Professional male tennis players did not show an anticipatory increase in SalCC the day of the match and neither signs of neuromuscular fatigue after it. During the match, the mild dehydration (i.e., &amp;lt;1.5%) was associated with the increases in cortisol levels which suggests that dehydration may be an added stress to be considered.</description><title>Hormonal and neuromuscular responses during a singles match in male professional tennis players</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd072:7c9981b6</id><updated>1523048400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</originId><published>1523048400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4405404f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Álvaro López-Samanes, Jesús G.

Despite an increase in dengue outbreaks and the arrival of chikungunya and Zika disease in Panama, studies on the demographic history of the invasive &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes that are the principle vectors of these diseases are still lacking in this region. Here, we assess the genetic diversity of these mosquitoes in order to decipher their invasion histories into the Isthmus of Panama. DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene obtained from 30 localities in 10 provinces confirmed the presence of more than one mitochondrial haplogroup (i.e., maternal lineage) in each species. The invasion of &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was likely from temperate European countries, as the most frequent and widespread haplogroup in Panama harbored variants that are uncommon elsewhere in the Americas. Two infrequent and geographically restricted &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; haplotypes appear to have subsequently invaded Panama from neighboring Costa Rica and the USA, respectively. In addition, we recovered two deeply divergent mitochondrial clades in Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. The geographic origins of these clades is unknown, given that divergence in the mitochondrial genome is probably due to ancient population processes within the native range of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;, rather than due to its global expansion out of Africa. However, Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mitochondrial sequences within the first clade were closely related to others from Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico and the USA, suggesting two separate invasions from Western Hemisphere source populations. The pattern of increased genetic diversity in &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes in Panama is likely facilitated by the numerous land and water inter-connections across the country, which allows them to enter via sea- and land-transportation from Europe, North, Central and South America. Our results here should be considered in disease mitigation programs if emergent arboviruses are to be effectively diminished in Panama through vector suppression.</content></content><author><name>Gilberto A.

By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (&lt;i&gt;Delphinium&lt;/i&gt; spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great.

By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (&lt;i&gt;Delphinium&lt;/i&gt; spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great. Agent-based models (ABMs) provide an effective method of testing alternate management strategies without risk to livestock. ABMs are especially useful for modeling complex systems such as livestock grazing management, and allow for realistic bottom-up encoding of cattle behavior. Here, we introduce a spatially-explicit, behavior-based ABM of cattle grazing in a pasture with a dangerous amount of Geyer’s larkspur (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;geyeri&lt;/i&gt;). This model tests the role of herd cohesion and stocking density in larkspur intake, finds that both are key drivers of larkspur-induced toxicosis, and indicates that alteration of these factors within realistic bounds can mitigate risk. Crucially, the model points to herd cohesion, which has received little attention in the discipline, as playing an important role in lethal acute toxicosis. As the first ABM to model grazing behavior at realistic scales, this study also demonstrates the tremendous potential of ABMs to illuminate grazing management dynamics, including fundamental aspects of livestock behavior amidst ecological heterogeneity.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23152-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>An ANOVA approach for statistical comparisons of brain networks</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23152-5</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1622e5474c5:11a096f:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23152-5/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23152_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>510</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23152-5</originId><published>1521183600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fb982e5f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/-PN2nbmA5AI/s41598-018-23152-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An ANOVA approach for statistical comparisons of brain networks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ANOVA approach for statistical comparisons of brain networks, Published online: 16 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23152-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23152-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An ANOVA approach for statistical comparisons of brain networks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-PN2nbmA5AI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Daniel Fraiman</name></author><crawled>1521195709637</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An ANOVA approach for statistical comparisons of brain networks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ANOVA approach for statistical comparisons of brain networks, Published online: 16 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23152-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23152-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An ANOVA approach for statistical comparisons of brain networks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-PN2nbmA5AI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>NOTCH activity differentially affects pituitary endocrine cell fate acquisition and maintenance</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33318</link><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16262379cf2:58c518f:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33318</canonicalUrl><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33318</originId><crawled>1522066234610</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><fingerprint>6568483</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The pituitary is an essential endocrine gland regulating multiple processes.

Polarity establishment, the spontaneous generation of asymmetric molecular distributions, is a crucial component of many cellular functions. &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; (yeast) undergoes directed growth during budding and mating, and is an ideal model organism for studying polarization. In yeast and many other cell types, the Rho GTPase Cdc42 is the key molecular player in polarity establishment. During yeast polarization, multiple patches of Cdc42 initially form, then resolve into a single front. Because polarization relies on strong positive feedback, it is likely that the amplification of molecular-level fluctuations underlies the generation of multiple nascent patches. In the absence of spatial cues, these fluctuations may be key to driving polarization. Here we used particle-based simulations to investigate the role of stochastic effects in a Turing-type model of yeast polarity establishment. In the model, reactions take place either between two molecules on the membrane, or between a cytosolic and a membrane-bound molecule. Thus, we developed a computational platform that explicitly simulates molecules at and near the cell membrane, and implicitly handles molecules away from the membrane. To evaluate stochastic effects, we compared particle simulations to deterministic reaction-diffusion equation simulations. Defining macroscopic rate constants that are consistent with the microscopic parameters for this system is challenging, because diffusion occurs in two dimensions and particles exchange between the membrane and cytoplasm. We address this problem by empirically estimating macroscopic rate constants from appropriately designed particle-based simulations. Ultimately, we find that stochastic fluctuations speed polarity establishment and permit polarization in parameter regions predicted to be Turing stable. These effects can operate at Cdc42 abundances expected of yeast cells, and promote polarization on timescales consistent with experimental results. To our knowledge, our work represents the first particle-based simulations of a model for yeast polarization that is based on a Turing mechanism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ccfBadz21A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Michael Pablo</name></author><crawled>1520877508959</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Pablo, Samuel A.

Many scientists studying animal welfare appear to hold a hedonistic concept of welfare -whereby welfare is ultimately reducible to an animal’s subjective experience. The substantial advances in assessing animal’s subjective experience have enabled us to take a step back to consider whether such indicators are all one needs to know if one is interested in the welfare of an individual. To investigate this claim, we randomly assigned participants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 502) to read one of four vignettes describing a hypothetical chimpanzee and asked them to make judgments about the animal’s welfare. Vignettes were designed to systematically manipulate the descriptive mental states the chimpanzee was described as experiencing: feels good (FG) vs. feels bad (FB); as well as non-subjective features of the animal’s life: natural living and physical healthy (NH) vs. unnatural life and physically unhealthy (UU); creating a fully-crossed 2 (subjective experience) X 2 (objective life value) experimental design. Multiple regression analysis showed welfare judgments depended on the objective features of the animal’s life more than they did on how the animal was feeling: a chimpanzee living a natural life with negative emotions was rated as having better welfare than a chimpanzee living an unnatural life with positive emotions. We also found that the supposedly more purely psychological concept of happiness was also influenced by normative judgments about the animal’s life. For chimpanzees with positive emotions, those living a more natural life were rated as happier than those living an unnatural life. Insofar as analyses of animal welfare are assumed to be reflective of folk intuitions, these findings raise questions about a strict hedonistic account of animal welfare. More generally, this research demonstrates the potential utility of using empirical methods to address conceptual problems in animal welfare and ethics.</content></content><author><name>Jesse Robbins</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jesse Robbins, Becca Franks, Marina A.

The polyphagous insect-pest, &lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa armigera&lt;/i&gt;, is a serious threat to a number of economically important crops. Chemical application and/or cultivation of &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; transgenic crops are the two strategies available now for insect-pest management. However, environmental pollution and long-term sustainability are major concerns against these two options. RNAi is now considered as a promising technology to complement &lt;i&gt;Bt&lt;/i&gt; to tackle insect-pests menace. In this study, we report host-delivered silencing of &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt; gene, encoding the predominant isoform of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armigera&lt;/i&gt; acetylcholinesterase, by an artificial microRNA, &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1.

The recombinant &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-preamiRNA1 was put under the control of CaMV 35S promoter and NOS terminator of plant binary vector pBI121, and the resultant vector cassette was used for tobacco transformation. Two transgenic tobacco lines expressing &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt;-amiR1 was used for detached leaf insect feeding bioassays. Larval mortality of 25% and adult deformity of 20% were observed in transgenic treated insect group over that control tobacco treated insect group. The reduction in the steady-state level of &lt;i&gt;HaAce1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA was 70–80% in the defective adults compared to control.

The environmental fates of pharmaceuticals and the effects of crop protection products on non-target species are subjects that are undergoing intense review. Since measuring the concentrations and effects of xenobiotics on all affected species under all conceivable scenarios is not feasible, standard laboratory animals such as rabbits are tested, and the observed adverse effects are translated to focal species for environmental risk assessments. In that respect, mathematical modelling is becoming increasingly important for evaluating the consequences of pesticides in untested scenarios. In particular, physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (PBPK/TK) modelling is a well-established methodology used to predict tissue concentrations based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs and toxicants. In the present work, a rabbit PBPK/TK model is developed and evaluated with data available from the literature. The model predictions include scenarios of both intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) administration of small and large compounds. The presented rabbit PBPK/TK model predicts the pharmacokinetics (Cmax, AUC) of the tested compounds with an average 1.7-fold error. This result indicates a good predictive capacity of the model, which enables its use for risk assessment modelling and simulations.</content></content><author><name>Panteleimon D.

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Javier A.

Many physical simulations aim at evaluating the net interaction between two rigid bodies, resulting from the cumulative effect of pairwise interactions between their constituents. This is manifested particularly in biomolecular applications such as hierarchical protein folding instances where the interaction between almost rigid domains directly influences the folding pathway, the interaction between macromolecules for drug design purposes, self-assembly of nanoparticles for drug design and drug delivery, and design of smart materials and bio-sensors. In general, the brute force approach requires quadratic (in terms of the number of particles) number of pairwise evaluation operations for any relative pose of the two bodies, unless simplifying assumptions lead to a collapse of the computational complexity. We propose to approximate the pairwise interaction function using a linear predictor function, in which the basis functions have separated forms, i.e. the variables that describe local geometries of the two rigid bodies and the ones that reflect the relative pose between them are split in each basis function. Doing so replaces the quadratic number of interaction evaluations for each relative pose with a one-time quadratic computation of a set of characteristic parameters at a preprocessing step, plus constant number of pose function evaluations at each pose, where this constant is determined by the required accuracy of approximation as well as the efficiency of the used approximation method. We will show that the standard deviation of the error for the net interaction is linearly (in terms of number of particles) proportional to the regression error, if the regression errors are from a normal distribution. Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision.</content></content><author><name>Pouya Tavousi</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pouya Tavousi&lt;/p&gt;

This analysis identifies Southeast Asia as having many highly related isolates, possibly as a result of both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified, most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail. Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread between continents while the other has arisen independently in different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure, positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination efforts of many diseases.</content></content><author><name>Henden, L.</name></author><crawled>1521054139161</crawled><description>Identification of genomic regions that are identical by descent (IBD) has proven useful for human genetic studies where analyses have led to the discovery of familial relatedness and fine-mapping of disease critical regions.

This analysis identifies Southeast Asia as having many highly related isolates, possibly as a result of both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified, most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail. Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread between continents while the other has arisen independently in different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure, positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination efforts of many diseases.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Rating experiments in forestry: How much agreement is there in tree marking?</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34af:34f43e70</id><updated>1521752400000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</originId><published>1521752400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>54ebcb40</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arne Pommerening, Carlos Pallarés Ramos, Wojciech Kędziora, Jens Haufe, Dietrich Stoyan&lt;/p&gt;
The process of selecting individual trees by humans for forest management purposes is the result of a plethora of factors and processes that are hard to disentangle. And yet in the past many textbooks and other publications have maintained that this selection leads to somewhat unanimous results. In this study, we analysed the data of 36 so-called marteloscope experiments from all over Britain, which are managed by the Ae Training Centre (Scotland, UK). Our objective was (1) to establish how much agreement there actually was when asking test persons (raters) to apply two different thinning methods, low and crown thinning. In addition we (2) were interested in understanding some of the processes leading to certain levels of agreement and in relationships between the agreement measures and characteristics of forest structure. Our analysis was based on multivariate statistics, particularly using Fleiss’ kappa. This was the first time that an analysis of rater behaviour was performed at such a large scale and it revealed that the general agreement in tree selection in Britain was only slight to fair, i.e. much lower than in medical experiments. The variability of selecting individual trees was considerable. We also found that agreement in tree selection was much stronger in low-thinning as opposed to crown-thinning experiments. As the latter is an important method of Continuous Cover Forestry and British forestry is increasingly adopting this forest management type, our results suggested that there is a need to provide more training. Interestingly the different levels of agreement as identified by Fleiss’ kappa could not be explained by measures of forest structure, however, the mean conformity number, a surrogate of Fleiss’ kappa, showed correlations and indicated that conformity increased with increasing complexity of tree stem diameter structure.</content></content><author><name>Arne Pommerening</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arne Pommerening, Carlos Pallarés Ramos, Wojciech Kędziora, Jens Haufe, Dietrich Stoyan&lt;/p&gt;

Genetic differences contribute to variations in the immune response mounted by different individuals to a pathogen. Such differential response can influence the spread of infectious disease, indicating why such diseases impact some populations more than others. Here, we study the impact of population-level genetic heterogeneity on the epidemic spread of different strains of H1N1 influenza. For a population with known HLA class-I allele frequency and for a given H1N1 viral strain, we classify individuals into sub-populations according to their level of susceptibility to infection. Our core hypothesis is that the susceptibility of a given individual to a disease such as H1N1 influenza is inversely proportional to the number of high affinity viral epitopes the individual can present. This number can be extracted from the HLA genetic profile of the individual. We use ethnicity-specific HLA class-I allele frequency data, together with genome sequences of various H1N1 viral strains, to obtain susceptibility sub-populations for 61 ethnicities and 81 viral strains isolated in 2009, as well as 85 strains isolated in other years. We incorporate these data into a multi-compartment SIR model to analyse the epidemic dynamics for these (ethnicity, viral strain) epidemic pairs. Our results show that HLA allele profiles which lead to a large spread in individual susceptibility values can act as a protective barrier against the spread of influenza. We predict that populations skewed such that a small number of highly susceptible individuals coexist with a large number of less susceptible ones, should exhibit smaller outbreaks than populations with the same average susceptibility but distributed more uniformly across individuals. Our model tracks some well-known qualitative trends of influenza spread worldwide, suggesting that HLA genetic diversity plays a crucial role in determining the spreading potential of different influenza viral strains across populations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x5hYH_0EN7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Narmada Sambaturu</name></author><crawled>1521654476064</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Narmada Sambaturu, Sumanta Mukherjee, Martín López-García, Carmen Molina-París, Gautam I.

Sustained virological response (SVR) rates have increased remarkably since the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C. Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme converting lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid and a newly established biomarker for liver fibrosis. Interferon-free DAA regimens for chronic hepatitis C could improve liver stiffness in SVR patients according to several non-invasive evaluation methods, but the clinical response and significance of ATX in this context have not yet been defined. We therefore investigated sequential serum ATX levels at baseline, 4 weeks after the start of treatment, and 24 weeks after treatment in 159 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients who received DAA therapy. Other non-invasive fibrosis markers (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio and FIB-4 index) were examined as well. Baseline median ATX levels were comparable between the 144 patients who achieved a SVR and the 15 who did not (1.54 vs. 1.62 mg/L), but median ATX levels became significantly decreased during and after DAA therapy in the SVR group only (from 1.54 to 1.40 and 1.31 mg/L, respectively; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ATX was significantly decreased between baseline and 4 weeks of treatment in overall, male, and female SVR patients (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In subjects with low necroinflammatory activity in the liver (i.e., alanine aminotransferase &amp;lt; 30 U/L), ATX levels were significantly reduced from baseline to 4 weeks of treatment and remained low (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) in patients with a SVR.

Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical features of postoperative delirium are similar to the core features of alpha synuclein-related cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which precede the cardinal motor features of PD, are likely to be risk factors for developing postoperative delirium. We investigated the association between PD-related NMSs and postoperative delirium in old people undergoing elective spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective study. Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis. We assessed eight easily-assessed and representative PD-related NMSs 1 day before the scheduled surgery using tests or questionnaires for each symptom. The presence of delirium was determined by using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Fifteen (14.4%) of the 104 participants (age, 71.7 ± 4.7 years; men, 34.6%) met the CAM criteria for post-operative delirium. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that decreased olfactory function (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.44–0.91) and exhibiting rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD, OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09–1.93) were significantly independent predictors of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study shows that hyposmia and RBD are significantly independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in general elderly population. Considering that NMSs may represent burden of alpha synuclein deposit, we postulate that an underlying alpha synucleinopathy may correlates with postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Significance &lt;p&gt;This study gives a novel insight for the risk factor of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Ki Hoon Kim</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ki Hoon Kim, Suk Yun Kang, Dong Ah Shin, Seong Yi, Yoon Ha, Keung Nyun Kim, Young Ho Sohn, Phil Hyu Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis. We assessed eight easily-assessed and representative PD-related NMSs 1 day before the scheduled surgery using tests or questionnaires for each symptom. The presence of delirium was determined by using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Fifteen (14.4%) of the 104 participants (age, 71.7 ± 4.7 years; men, 34.6%) met the CAM criteria for post-operative delirium. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that decreased olfactory function (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.44–0.91) and exhibiting rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD, OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09–1.93) were significantly independent predictors of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study shows that hyposmia and RBD are significantly independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in general elderly population. Considering that NMSs may represent burden of alpha synuclein deposit, we postulate that an underlying alpha synucleinopathy may correlates with postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Significance &lt;p&gt;This study gives a novel insight for the risk factor of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Susceptibility of brain atrophy to TRIB3 in Alzheimer’s disease, evidence from functional prioritization in imaging genetics [Computer Sciences]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3162.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6bf:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3162</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3162.short?rss=1</originId><published>1521567125000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>864558e2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3162.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The joint modeling of brain imaging information and genetic data is a promising research avenue to highlight the functional role of genes in determining the pathophysiological mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Following the indication of the World Health Organization, a national plan for the elimination of measles was approved in Italy and this included the improvement of the molecular surveillance of measles viruses and the interruption of indigenous transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, large outbreaks continue to occur in almost all regions of the country, including Sicily. Here we describe the epidemiology and molecular dynamics of measles viruses as a result of the measles surveillance activity carried out by the “Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella” in Sicily over a 5-year period. Biological samples of 259 suspected measles cases were tested for viral RNA detection and a total of 223 (86.1%) were classified as laboratory confirmed. The median age of confirmed measles cases was 21.0 years and about half of them were adults aged 19 years and older. Overall, one-third of the patients showed clinical complications and these latter were more common among adults than children (44.9% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 25.7%). The vast majority of measles cases were unvaccinated (94.2%, n = 210). The phylogenetic analysis of 221 measles virus nucleotide sequences revealed sporadic detections of genotypes D4 and H1, while endemic circulation of genotypes D8 and B3 was documented. Genotype D8 was associated with epidemics occurred between 2013 and 2016, whereas genotype B3 was more recently introduced into Sicily characterizing the current measles outbreak. The results of this study confirm the autochthonous co-circulation of viral variants belonging to different genotypes during the study period, and emphasizes the need of measles surveillance programmes in order to investigate the viral dynamics, the pathways of disease transmission, and to eventually adapt the development of successfull vaccine formulations.</content></content><author><name>Fabio Tramuto</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Tramuto, Carmelo Massimo Maida, Fanny Pojero, Giuseppina Maria Elena Colomba, Alessandra Casuccio, Vincenzo Restivo, Francesco Vitale&lt;/p&gt;

Two plasma devices at atmospheric pressure (air dielectric barrier discharge and helium plasma jet) have been used to study the early germination of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; seeds during the first days. Then, plasma activated waters are used during the later stage of plant development and growth until 42 days. The effects on both testa and endospserm ruptures during the germination stage are significant in the case of air plasma due to its higher energy and efficiency of producing reactive oxygen species than the case of helium plasma. The latter has shown distinct effects only for testa rupture. Analysis of germination stimulations are based on specific stainings for reactive oxygen species production, peroxidase activity and also membrane permeability tests. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown a smoother seed surface for air plasma treated seeds that can explain the plasma induced-germination. During the growth stage, plants were watered using 4 kinds of water (tap and deionized waters activated or not by the low temperature plasma jet). With regards to other water kinds, the characterization of the tap water has shown a larger conductivity, acidity and concentration of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Only the tap water activated by the plasma jet has shown a significant effect on the plant growth. This effect could be correlated to reactive nitrogen species such as nitrite/nitrate species present in plasma activated tap water.</content></content><author><name>Maxime Bafoil</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maxime Bafoil, Achraf Jemmat, Yves Martinez, Nofel Merbahi, Olivier Eichwald, Christophe Dunand, Mohammed Yousfi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Unstable conditions of the craniocervical junction such as atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) or atlanto-axial instability (AAI) are severe injuries with a high risk of tetraplegia or death. Immobilization by a cervical collar to protect the patient from secondary damage is a standard procedure in trauma patients. If the application of a cervical collar to a patient with an unstable craniocervical condition may cause segmental motion and secondary injury to the spinal cord is unknown.The aim of the current study is (i) to analyze compression on the dural sac and (ii) to determine relative motion of the cervical spine during the procedure of applying a cervical collar in case of ligamentous unstable craniocervical junction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Ligamentous AOD as well as AOD combined with ligamentous AAI was simulated in two newly developed cadaveric trauma models. Compression of the dural sac and segmental angulation in the upper cervical spine were measured on video fluoroscopy after myelography during the application of a cervical collar. Furthermore, overall three-dimensional motion of the cervical spine was measured by a motion tracking system.In six cadavers each, the two new trauma models on AOD and AOD combined with AAI could be implemented. Mean dural sac compression was significantly increased to -1.1 mm (-1.3 to -0.7 mm) in case of AOD and -1.2 mm (-1.6 to -0.6 mm) in the combined model of AOD and AAI. Furthermore, there is a significant increased angulation at the C0/C1 level in the AOD model. Immense three-dimensional movement up to 22.9° of cervical spine flexion was documented during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The current study pointed out that applying a cervical collar in general will cause immense three-dimensional movement.

We first show that scVI scales to over one million cells, whereas competing algorithms can process at most tens of thousands of cells. Next, we show that scVI fits unseen data more closely and can impute missing data more accurately, both indicative of a better generalization capacity. We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks -- including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression -- and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.</content></content><author><name>Lopez, R.</name></author><crawled>1522394646441</crawled><description>Transcriptome profiles of individual cells reflect true and often unexplored biological diversity, but are also affected by noise of biological and technical nature.

We first show that scVI scales to over one million cells, whereas competing algorithms can process at most tens of thousands of cells. Next, we show that scVI fits unseen data more closely and can impute missing data more accurately, both indicative of a better generalization capacity. We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks -- including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression -- and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.</description></item><item><engagement>42</engagement><title>Random copolymers that protect proteins</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1216?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d25142:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/1216.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1216?rss=1</originId><crawled>1521143966531</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Materials Science</item></keywords><fingerprint>3843b3f6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1216?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Alexander-Katz, A., Van Lehn, R.

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Mehdi Bouhaddou</name></author><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

Increasingly, ecoimmunology studies aim to use relevant pathogen exposure to examine the impacts of infection on physiological processes in wild animals. Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (“arboviruses”) responsible for millions of cases of human illnesses each year. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is a unique alphavirus that is transmitted by a cimicid insect, the swallow bug, and is amplified in two avian species: the house sparrow (&lt;i&gt;Passer domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) and the cliff swallow (&lt;i&gt;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota)&lt;/i&gt;. BCRV, like many alphaviruses, exhibits age-dependent susceptibility where the young are most susceptible to developing disease and exhibit a high mortality rate. However, alphavirus disease etiology in nestling birds is unknown. In this study, we infected nestling house sparrows with Buggy Creek virus and measured virological, pathological, growth, and digestive parameters following infection. Buggy Creek virus caused severe encephalitis in all infected nestlings, and the peak viral concentration in brain tissue was over 34 times greater than any other tissue. Growth, tissue development, and digestive function were all significantly impaired during BCRV infection. However, based on histopathological analysis performed, this impairment does not appear to be the result of direct tissue damage by the virus, but likely caused by encephalitis and neuronal invasion and impairment of the central nervous system. This is the first study to examine the course of alphavirus diseases in nestling birds and these results will improve our understanding of age-dependent infections of alphaviruses in vertebrate hosts.</content></content><author><name>Carol A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the number of studies that have tried to demonstrate that there is an association between previous falls and the fear of falling, the relationship between these two variables remains a matter of controversy.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our objective was to investigate whether the fear of falling is a cause of falls, a consequence, or both in community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive, longitudinal, prospective study was performed. A total of 640 individuals were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. Sociodemographic data, health status, history of falls and fear of falling were assessed at baseline and at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of falls at baseline was 25% as opposed to 35.2% at 24 months. The prevalence of the fear of falling was 41.5% at baseline. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between a history of falls and the fear of falling. Other factors associated with the fear of falling were female gender, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability. In total, 41.7% of the subjects who had reported a fear of falling at baseline had suffered at least one fall 24 months later. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the fear of falling was a risk factor for falls. According to the final model adjusted for other covariates, the only reliable predictor was female gender. The Cox model stratified by gender failed to show a crude association between fear of falling and falls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A previous history of falls in the previous year was a good predictor of the fear of falling; but the fear of falling was a predictor of falls during follow-up only in the unadjusted model, pointing to strong gender turns out as an effect modifier of the association of FOF and subsequent falls.

CAMSAP2 was also important for persistent endothelial cell sprouting during &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish vessel development. In the absence of CAMSAP2, cell polarization in 3D could be partly rescued by centrosome depletion, indicating that in these conditions the centrosome inhibited cell polarity.

CAMSAP2 was also important for persistent endothelial cell sprouting during &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish vessel development. In the absence of CAMSAP2, cell polarization in 3D could be partly rescued by centrosome depletion, indicating that in these conditions the centrosome inhibited cell polarity. We propose that CAMSAP2-protected non-centrosomal microtubules are needed for establishing cell asymmetry by enabling microtubule enrichment in a single cell protrusion.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>The combination of &amp;lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&amp;lt;/i&gt; L. and &amp;lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&amp;lt;/i&gt; M. exhibits a laxative effect on loperamide-induced constipation of rats</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195624</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d748:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1522962000000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195624</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195624</originId><published>1522962000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>302f39ea</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195624</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Hee Jang, Dong Kwon Yang&lt;/p&gt;
Chronic constipation is a functional gastrointestinal disease that is detrimental to the quality of patient life. &lt;i&gt;Cassia obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; L. (CO) and &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; M. (FV) are commonly used as medicinal foods in many countries. We aimed to examine the laxative effect and their underlying mechanism of CO and FV mixture on loperamide (lop)-induced constipated rats. To determine the laxative effects of these compounds, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: the control, lop-induced constipated (2mg/kg), and three doses (100, 300, and 500mg/kg) of CO and FV mixture-, and Bisacodyl (bis, 3.3mg/kg)-treated groups. The mixture of CO and FV and bis were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks. For induction of constipation, the lop were treated with a dose of 2 mg/kg twice a day on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week after treatments of CO and FV extracts and bis. The results were revealed that the CO and FV mixture has the laxative effects more than those in CO and FV-alone treatments on constipated rats by determining the stool parameters, including stool number and weight. Indeed, stool parameters, such as, stool number, weight, and water contents and colonic peristalsis from the intestinal transit length and ratio were dramatically improved by CO and FV mixture treatment. Histological study also revealed that CO and FV mixture enhanced the thicknesses of mucosa and muscular layers of the colon in constipated rats. For their underlying mechanism, the mRNAs and proteins expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAchR) M2 and M3 and their downstream signaling were preserved by CO and FV mixture treatment in constipated rats. Therefore, this study suggests that treatment with CO and FV mixture has beneficial effects against constipation. We further suggest that CO and FV mixture may be utilized as an alternative therapeutic strategy for constipation.</content></content><author><name>Seung Hee Jang</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Hee Jang, Dong Kwon Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cochrane reviewers are strongly encouraged to evaluate the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes by using the GRADE approach and to report these results in a Summary of Findings (SoF) table. We aimed to assess whether outcomes reported in the SoF table of Cochrane reviews could be considered patient-important outcomes (PIOs) and the quality of the available evidence for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a methodological review of Cochrane reviews published between March 2011 and September 2014. For a random sample of Cochrane reviews reporting a SoF table, we extracted all outcomes reported in this table and evaluated whether they could be considered PIOs (i.e., mortality, other clinical events, adverse events, function, pain, quality of life and therapeutic decisions). Then, we collected the quality of evidence for every outcome in these SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 290 reviews issued by 47 of the 53 Cochrane Review Groups. Every SoF table included a median of 5 outcomes, for a total of 1414 outcomes; 1089 (77%) could be considered PIOs. Almost all reviews (n = 278, 96%) included at least one PIO in their SoF table. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was high for 12% (n = 168), moderate for 28% (n = 402) and low or very low for 45% (n = 640). Less than one quarter of reviews (n = 63) included at least one PIO with high-quality evidence that favoured a benefit of the experimental intervention evaluated in half of them (n = 34 reviews).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Many outcomes reported in the SoF table of recent Cochrane reviews can be considered PIOs. However, the quality of available evidence remains limited for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Youri Yordanov</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youri Yordanov, Agnes Dechartres, Philippe Ravaud&lt;/p&gt;

This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed at exploring the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain evoked by cold stimulation and on spontaneous pain in patients with lumbar radicular (neuropathic) pain.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data was collected from 35 patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (18 men, mean age 56.2±13 years). The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In addition, apomorphine prolonged cold pain tolerance but not threshold in the painful site (from a median of 43.0 seconds (IQR = 63.0) at baseline to 51.0 seconds (IQR = 78.0) at 120 min, p = 0.02). Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>May Haddad</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by May Haddad, Dorit Pud, Roi Treister, Erica Suzan, Elon Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Simulation is regarded as an effective educational method for the delivery of clinical scenarios. However, exposure to unfamiliar environments during simulation can cause excessive stress among students, possibly leading to unnatural speech/behavior and poor skill learning (Yerkes-Dodson’s law). Thus, assessing students’ stress in a simulation can provide educators with a better understanding of their mental state. This study sought to clarify stress changes throughout the progression of the simulation by measuring heart rate variability and students’ subjective reactions in 74 nursing students. Heart rate variability was calculated in terms of its high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) components during 4 phases—the break, patient care, reporting, and debriefing. Students were interviewed about stress experienced during the simulation. The results showed that HF decreased significantly from the break to the patient care and reporting phases. Furthermore, LF/HF increased significantly from the break to the reporting phases. Approximately 55 students felt stressed during the simulation, 24 of whom felt most stressed during the reporting phase. Therefore, the reporting phase involved high objective and subjective stress. It may be possible that the educator’s evaluative attitude increased students’ stress. Therefore, a stress intervention during the reporting phase might further improve students’ performance during that phase. The debriefing phase did not significantly differ from the break phase for objective stress, and students did not report feeling stressed. Thus, in this phase, they were released from the stress of the reporting phase and the unfamiliar environment. During this phase, they might be able to learn what they could not understand owing to high stress in the patient care and reporting phases. This study provides objective and subjective evidence of students’ stress during simulation, and indicates the necessity of providing support during the reporting phase and the importance of debriefing when using clinical scenarios for teaching clinical skills.</content></content><author><name>Natsuki Nakayama</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natsuki Nakayama, Naoko Arakawa, Harumi Ejiri, Reiko Matsuda, Tsuneko Makino&lt;/p&gt;

Social exclusion is a painful experience that is felt as a threat to the human need to belong and can lead to increased aggressive and anti-social behaviours, and results in emotional and cognitive numbness. Excluded individuals also seem to show an automatic tuning to positivity: they tend to increase their selective attention towards social acceptance signals. Despite these effects known in the literature, the consequences of social exclusion on social information processing still need to be explored in depth. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of social exclusion on processing two features that are strictly bound in the appraisal of the meaning of facial expressions: gaze direction and emotional expression. In two experiments (N = 60, N = 45), participants were asked to identify gaze direction or emotional expressions from facial stimuli, in which both these features were manipulated. They performed these tasks in a four-block crossed design after being socially included or excluded using the Cyberball game. Participants’ empathy and self-reported emotions were recorded using the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and PANAS questionnaires. The Need Threat Scale and three additional questions were also used as manipulation checks in the second experiment. In both experiments, excluded participants showed to be less accurate than included participants in gaze direction discrimination. Modulatory effects of direct gaze (Experiment 1) and sad expression (Experiment 2) on the effects of social exclusion were found on response times (RTs) in the emotion recognition task. Specific differences in the reaction to social exclusion between males and females were also found in Experiment 2: excluded male participants tended to be less accurate and faster than included male participants, while excluded females showed a more accurate and slower performance than included female participants. No influence of social exclusion on PANAS or EQ scores was found. Results are discussed in the context of the importance of identifying gaze direction in appraisal theories.</content></content><author><name>Francesco Bossi</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Bossi, Marcello Gallucci, Paola Ricciardelli&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding maternity roost requirements is fundamental to guide timber production forest management given such roosts are vital to sustain bat populations. We tracked lactating females of three tree cavity-roosting species: Gould&apos;s long-eared bat (&lt;i&gt;Nyctophilus gouldi&lt;/i&gt;) (n = 7), eastern broad-nosed bat (&lt;i&gt;Scotorepens orion&lt;/i&gt;) (n = 6) and little forest bat (&lt;i&gt;Vespadelus vulturnus&lt;/i&gt;) (n = 25), over five weeks in young (predominately &amp;lt;5years old) forest regenerating from heavy timber harvest in southeast Australia. We aimed to investigate interspecific maternity roost selection in a regenerating landscape and by doing so, increase our understanding of the three species’ roost ecology. Sixteen &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vulturnus&lt;/i&gt;, 15 &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gouldi&lt;/i&gt; and six &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;orion&lt;/i&gt; unique maternity roost trees were located. Bats displayed a degree of maternity roost selection plasticity, however, interspecific differences were found. &lt;i&gt;Nyctophilus gouldi&lt;/i&gt; roosted selectively in retained riparian buffers, in trees of high senescence and switched roosts every day. &lt;i&gt;Vespadelus vulturnus&lt;/i&gt; roosted in logged areas and displayed high roost site fidelity, with one roost used for 33 consecutive days. &lt;i&gt;Scotorepens orion&lt;/i&gt; selected large live trees of low senescence. The preliminary data for this species suggests that females roost most days in ‘primary’ roosts but display a roost switching behaviour conforming to the fission-fusion model. Dead trees were identified to be important for both &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gouldi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vulturnus&lt;/i&gt;. Historical and recent logging at our study area drastically reduced cavity-bearing tree density to 1.4 trees per hectare in the logging zones (outside of exclusion areas), potentially limiting local populations of tree cavity-roosting bats and other cavity-dependent wildlife. Our data demonstrate that forest management must consider a range of maternity roost requirements to accommodate differences among species and highlight the importance of exclusion areas for roost habitat. We propose that an expanded ‘retention forestry’ approach should be implemented in logged areas that includes in-perpetuity forest patch retention to increase habitat complexity and continuity.</content></content><author><name>Niels Rueegger</name></author><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Niels Rueegger, Brad Law, Ross Goldingay&lt;/p&gt;

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction following left ventricular (LV) failure is associated with poor prognosis. RV remodeling is thought initiated by the increase in the afterload of RV due to secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) to impaired LV function; however, RV molecular changes might occur in earlier stages of the disease. cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)-phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, widely used to treat PH through their pulmonary vasorelaxation properties, have shown direct cardiac benefits, but their impacts on the RV in LV diseases are not fully determined. Here we show that RV molecular alterations occur early in the absence of RV hemodynamic changes during LV pressure-overload and are ameliorated by PDE5 inhibition. Two-day moderate LV pressure-overload (transverse aortic constriction) neither altered RV pressure/ function nor RV weight in mice, while it induced only mild LV hypertrophy. Importantly, pathological molecular features were already induced in the RV free wall myocardium, including up-regulation of gene markers for hypertrophy and inflammation, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and calcineurin. Concomitant PDE5 inhibition (sildenafil) prevented induction of such pathological genes and activation of ERK and calcineurin in the RV as well as in the LV. Importantly, dexamethasone also prevented these RV molecular changes, similarly to sildenafil treatment. These results suggest the contributory role of inflammation to the early pathological interventricular interaction between RV and LV. The current study provides the first evidence for the novel early molecular cross-talk between RV and LV, preceding RV hemodynamic changes in LV disease, and supports the therapeutic strategy of enhancing cGMP signaling pathway to treat heart diseases.</content></content><author><name>Yousuke Imai</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yousuke Imai, Taro Kariya, Masaki Iwakiri, Yoshitsugu Yamada, Eiki Takimoto&lt;/p&gt;

Random fluctuations in the amount of cellular components like mRNA and protein molecules are inevitable due to the stochastic and discrete nature of biochemical reactions. If large enough, this so-called “cellular noise” can lead to random transitions between the expression states of a multistable genetic circuit. That way, heterogeneity within isogenic populations is created. Our aim is to understand which dynamical features of a simple autoregulatory system determine its intrinsic noise level, and how they can be modified in order to regulate state-transitions. To that end, novel mathematical methods for the state-dependent characterization and prediction of noise in multistable systems are developed. First, we introduce the hybrid LNA, a modified version of the Linear Noise Approximation. It yields good predictions on variances of mRNA and protein fluctuations, even for reaction systems comprising low-copy-number components (e.g. mRNA) and highly nonlinear reaction rates. Furthermore, the temporal structure of fluctuations and the skewness of the protein distribution are characterized via state-dependent protein burst sizes and burst frequencies. Based on this mathematical framework, we develop graphical methods which support the intuitive design of regulatory circuits with a desired noise pattern. The methods are then used to predict how overall noise in the system can be adapted, and how state-specific noise modifications are possible that allow, e.g., the generation of unidirectional transitions. Our considerations are validated by stochastic simulations. This way, a design of genetic circuits is possible that takes population heterogeneity into account and is valuable in applications of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Moreover, natural phenomena like the bimodal development of genetic competence can be studied.</content></content><author><name>Sayuri Katharina Hortsch</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Katharina Hortsch, Andreas Kremling&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Disturbance of intestinal wound closure leads to insufficient anastomotic healing and is associated with considerable morbidity following colorectal resections. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in regulation of wound closure. Here fluorescence endoscopy was evaluated for assessment of MMP-2/-9 expression during failed intestinal anastomotic healing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Distal colonic anastomoses were performed as a model for disturbed healing in 36 Balb/c mice. Healing was evaluated endoscopically, macroscopically, and histologically after 1, 3 and 5 days. For detection of MMP-2/-9 expression fluorescence endoscopy (FE) was used following &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;administration of a Cy5.5-labeled MMP-2/-9 specific tracer. FE was complemented by quantification of the fluorescence signal using the MS-FX PRO Optical Imaging System. An overall leakage score was calculated and correlated with the results of FE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;With increasing incidence of anastomotic leakage from POD1 (17%) to POD5 (83%) the uptake of the MMP tracer gradually increased (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), POD1: 17.91 ± 1.251 vs. POD3: 30.56 ± 3.03 vs. POD5: 44.8 ± 4.473, P&amp;lt;0.0001). Mice with defective anastomotic healing showed significantly higher uptake compared to non-defective (SNR: 37.37± 3.63 vs. 26.16± 3.635, P = 0.0369). White light endoscopy and FE allowed evaluation of anastomotic healing and visualization of mucosal MMPs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using FE based detection of MMPs in the anastomosis, an overall positive predictive value of 71.4% and negative predictive value of 66.6% was calculated for detection of anastomotic leakage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;During disturbed anastomotic healing increased expression of MMP-2/-9 was observed in the anastomotic tissue.

Our previous research demonstrated that tilianin protects the myocardium in a myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) rat model and has prominent pharmacological potential as a cardiovascular drug. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular signaling implicated in the improvement of myocardial survival induced by tilianin, a flavonoid antioxidant. Tilianin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/d) or saline was orally administered to rats for 14 days. On the 15th day, ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 45 min, followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The levels of MIRI-induced serum myocardial enzymes and cardiomyocyte apoptosis as well as infarct size were examined to assess the cardioprotective effects. Cardiac tissues were collected for western blot analyses to determine the protein expression of anti-apoptotic signaling molecules. In MIRI-treated rats, our results revealed that pre-administration of high dose-tilianin the reduced release of LDH, MDA, and CK-MB and increased the plasma SOD level, and significantly attenuated the infarct size. Western blot analysis showed that a remarkable rise in expression of Bcl-2 and XIAP, and decline in expression of Bax, Smac/Diablo, HtrA2/Omi, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 was observed in the myocardium. The apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes further supports the cardioprotective effect of tilianin. Additionally, compared with the MIRI model group, pretreatment with high dose-tilianin group upregulated phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In contrast, using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block Akt activation effectively inhibited the protective effects of tilianin against MIRI. Tilianin pretreatment was beneficial for activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting myocardial apoptosis.</content></content><author><name>Cheng Zeng</name></author><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng Zeng, Wen Jiang, Ruifang Zheng, Chenghui He, Jianguang Li, Jianguo Xing&lt;/p&gt;

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity. Species conservation, however, requires species identification skills, a competence obtained through intensive training and experience. Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition. The idea of automated species identification is approaching reality. We review the technical status quo on computer vision approaches for plant species identification, highlight the main research challenges to overcome in providing applicable tools, and conclude with a discussion of open and future research thrusts.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bfmDpVYKmqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jana Wäldchen</name></author><crawled>1522950337465</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jana Wäldchen, Michael Rzanny, Marco Seeland, Patrick Mäder&lt;/p&gt;

Almost one third of the three million people in China suffering severe deafness are children, and 50% of these cases are believed to have genetic components to their etiology. Newborn hearing genetic screening can complement Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening for the diagnosis of congenital hearing loss as well as identifying children at risk for late-onset and progressive hearing impairment. The aim of this joint academic and Ministry of Health project was to prototype a cost effective newborn genetic screen in a community health setting on a city-wide level, and to ascertain the prevalence of variation at loci that have been associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. With the participation of 143 local hospitals in the city of Wuhan, China we screened 142,417 neonates born between May 2014 and Dec. 2015. The variants GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G, and mitochondrial variants m.1555A&gt;G and m.1494C&gt;T were assayed using real time PCR. Newborns found to carry a variant were re-assayed by sequencing in duplicate. Within a subset of 707 newborns we assayed using real-time PCR and ARMS-PCR to compare cost, sensitivity and operating procedure. The most frequent hearing loss associated allele detected in this population was the 235delC variant in GJB2 gene. In total, 4289 (3.01%) newborns were found to carry at least one allele of either GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G or two assayed MT-RNR1 variants. There was complete accordance between the real-time PCR and the ARMS PCR, though the real-time PCR had a much lower failure rate. Real-time PCR had a lower cost and operating time than ARMS PCR. Ongoing collaboration with the participating hospitals will determine the specificity and sensitivity of the association of the variants with hearing loss at birth and arising in early childhood, allowing an estimation of the benefits of newborn hearing genetic screening in a large-scale community setting.</content></content><author><name>Zongjie Hao</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zongjie Hao, Denggang Fu, Yang Ming, Jinlong Yang, Qi Huang, Weilong Lin, Huan Zhang, Bin Zhang, Aifen Zhou, Xijiang Hu, Cong Yao, Yunping Dong, Huijun Z.

European plum (&lt;i&gt;Prunus domestica&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an ancient domesticated species cultivated in temperate areas worldwide whose genetic structure has been scarcely analyzed to date. In this study, a broad representation of Spanish European plum germplasm collected in Northeastern Spain and a representative set of reference cultivars were compared using nuclear and chloroplast markers. The number of alleles per locus detected with the SSR markers ranged from 8 to 39, with an average of 23.4 alleles, and 8 haplotypes were identified. Bayesian model-based clustering, minimum spanning networks, and the analysis of molecular variance showed the existence of a hierarchical structure. At the first level, two genetic groups were found, one containing ‘Reine Claude’ type reference cultivars altogether with ca. 25% of local genotypes, and a second one much more diverse. This latter group split in two groups, one containing most (ca. 70%) local genotypes and some old Spanish and French reference cultivars, whereas the other included 24 reference cultivars and only six local genotypes. A third partition level allowed a significant finer delineation into five groups. As a whole, the genetic structure of European plum from Northeastern Spain was shown to be complex and conditioned by a geographical proximity factor. This study not only contributes to genetic conservation and breeding for this species at the national level, but also supports the relevance of undertaking similar tasks of collection and characterization in other unexplored areas. Moreover, this kind of research could lead to future coordinated actions for the examination of the whole European plum diversity, to define conservation strategies, and could be used to better understand the genetic control of traits of horticultural interest through association mapping.</content></content><author><name>Jorge Urrestarazu</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge Urrestarazu, Pilar Errea, Carlos Miranda, Luis G.

α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies found in synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Under the pathological conditions, α-syn tends to generate a diverse form of aggregates showing toxicity to neuronal cells and able to transmit across cells. However, mechanisms by which α-syn aggregates affect cytotoxicity in neurons have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that α-syn aggregates preferentially sequester specific synaptic proteins such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) through direct binding which is resistant to SDS. The sequestration effect of α-syn aggregates was shown in a cell-free system, cultured primary neurons, and PD mouse model. Furthermore, we identified a specific blocking peptide derived from VAMP2 which partially inhibited the sequestration by α-syn aggregates and contributed to reduced neurotoxicity. These results provide a mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by α-syn aggregates and suggest that the blocking peptide interfering with the pathological role of α-syn aggregates could be useful for designing a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of PD.</content></content><author><name>Mal-Gi Choi</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mal-Gi Choi, Mi Jin Kim, Do-Geun Kim, Ri Yu, You-Na Jang, Won-Jong Oh&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobial resistance against colistin has emerged worldwide threatening the efficacy of one of the last-resort antimicrobials used for the treatment of &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriacea&lt;/i&gt;e. To investigate the presence of the recently identified colistin resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt;) in China, we established PCRs to detect &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;5 on 213 anal and 1,339 nasal swabs from apparently healthy pigs (n = 1,454) in nine provinces, and 1,696 cloacal and 1,647 oropharyngeal samples from poultry (n = 1,836) at live-bird markets in 24 provinces of China. The prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (41.4%; 642/1,552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (11.5%; 384/3,343). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; gene was found in geese (49.5%, 54/109), chickens (17.2%, 257/1,498), pigeons (17.2%, 17/99) and ducks (15.4%, 20/130). In a similar trend, the prevalence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; in swine swabs (33.1%; 514/1552) was significantly higher than in swabs from poultry (5.6%; 187/3,343). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; was identified in geese (17.4%, 19/109), chickens (9.9%, 148/1,498), ducks (7.7%, 10/130) and pigeons (3%, 3/99). The &lt;i&gt;mcr-&lt;/i&gt;4 prevalence in the nasal swabs from pigs (59.2%, 58/98) was significantly higher than that in anal swabs (29.6%, 29/98) (P&amp;lt;0.001). Similarly, the &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; prevalence in the nasal swabs from pigs (61.2%, 60/98) was significantly higher than in anal swabs (44.9%, 44/98) (P = 0.02), and significantly higher in oropharyngeal swabs (7.2%, 109/1,507) than in the cloacal swabs (3.7%, 56/1,507) (P&amp;lt;0.001). This study further confirms the presence of the &lt;i&gt;mcr-4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mcr-5&lt;/i&gt; in animals and indicates these genes are prevalent and widespread in food producing animals (pig and poultry) in China.

This study investigated the role of individual differences (dark personality) and situational factors (perceived organisational support) in explaining intention to quit. Four hundred and fifty-one (50 of which females) ambulance personnel completed three questionnaires (Hogan Development Survey; Perceived Organisational Support Survey; and a single item Intention to Quit measure) as a part of a selection and development assessment. Employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, and Mischievous, but low on Colourful were found to have greater intentions to quit.

This study investigated the role of individual differences (dark personality) and situational factors (perceived organisational support) in explaining intention to quit. Four hundred and fifty-one (50 of which females) ambulance personnel completed three questionnaires (Hogan Development Survey; Perceived Organisational Support Survey; and a single item Intention to Quit measure) as a part of a selection and development assessment. Employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, and Mischievous, but low on Colourful were found to have greater intentions to quit. Additionally, employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, Reserved, and Leisurely, but low on Dutiful and Diligent had lower perceptions of organisational support. Structural Equation Modelling revealed that perceived organisational support plays both a mediating and moderating role on dark personality and intention to quit. Theoretical implications of personality’s role in perceived organisational support and intention to quit are discussed.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Gene cloning of a neutral ceramidase from the sphingolipid metabolic pathway based on transcriptome analysis of &amp;lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus muelleri&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194863</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4245:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194863</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194863</originId><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5bea8ad4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194863</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lin Zhong, Erxi Liu, Chaozhu Yang, Ying Diao, Nunung Harijati, Jiangdong Liu, Zhongli Hu, Surong Jin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; is a perennial herbaceous plant species mainly distributed in the tropics or subtropics of Asia and Africa. It has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time and now is utilized for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agriculture industries as a valued economic crop. Recently, &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt; has attracted tremendous interest because of its high ceramide content. However, the breeding and genome studies are severely limited by the arduous whole genome sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, the transcriptome data of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; was obtained by utilizing the high-throughput Illumina sequencing platform. Based on this information, the majority of the significant genes involved in the proposed sphingolipid metabolic pathway were identified. Then, the full-length neutral ceramidase cDNA was obtained with the help of its candidate transcripts, which were acquired from the transcriptome data. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this neutral ceramidase was a real ceramidase by eukaryotic expression in the yeast double knockout mutant Δypc1 Δydc1, which lacks the ceramidases—dihydroCDase (YDC1p), phytoCDase (YPC1p). In addition, the biochemical characterization of purified &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muelleri&lt;/i&gt; ceramidase (AmCDase) exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an optimal activity ranging from pH 6.5 to 8.0. Based on our knowledge, this study is the first to report the related information of the neutral ceramidase in &lt;i&gt;Amorphophallus&lt;/i&gt;.

We conducted a document analysis that explored publication ethics and authorship in the context of population biobanks from both a theoretical (e.g. normative documents) and practical (e.g. biobank-specific documentation) perspective. The aim was to provide an overview of the state of authorship attribution in population biobanks and attempt to fill the gap in discussions around the issue. Our findings demonstrate that the most common approach adopted in both the normative and biobank-specific documentation is acknowledgment. A co-authorship approach was second and highlighted concerns surrounding the fairness of imposing authorship of the scientific leadership as a condition to access data and biosamples, as well as the alignment with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’ criteria such as what is deemed a significant contribution and how to ensure accountability. Based on these findings, we propose a three-prong approach, that may be cumulative, to address the issue of authorship attribution in the context of population biobanks, namely 1) the biobank should be appropriately acknowledged; 2) an invitation for co-authorship should be made based on the spirit of collaboration and provided a substantial contribution has been made; and 3) a citation/referencing option should be available.</content></content><author><name>Erika Kleiderman</name></author><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erika Kleiderman, Amy Pack, Pascal Borry, Ma’n Zawati&lt;/p&gt;

Based on these findings, we propose a three-prong approach, that may be cumulative, to address the issue of authorship attribution in the context of population biobanks, namely 1) the biobank should be appropriately acknowledged; 2) an invitation for co-authorship should be made based on the spirit of collaboration and provided a substantial contribution has been made; and 3) a citation/referencing option should be available.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Involvement of the olfactory system in the induction of anti-fatigue effects by odorants</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195263</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde30:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1522357200000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195263</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195263</originId><published>1522357200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f52c8f06</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195263</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naoko Saito, Emi Yamano, Akira Ishii, Masaaki Tanaka, Junji Nakamura, Yasuyoshi Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;
Some components of the neural circuits underlying innate odor-evoked responses have recently been elucidated. Odor information detected by the olfactory receptors is transmitted from the olfactory bulb to the cortical amygdala, where physiological and emotional states such as attraction or avoidance are controlled. Thus, activation of specific olfactory receptors can elicit changes in physiological and/or psychological state. Here, we examined on the odorant Hex-Hex Mix, which has been reported to induce anti-fatigue effects. Fatigue is a prevalent condition that is often related to overwork and psychological stress. Various anti-fatigue treatments have been developed, including supplements and odorants. However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-fatigue effects of these substances are currently unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the involvement of the olfactory system in the mechanisms underlying this effect. We identified the human olfactory receptors activated by Hex-Hex Mix, and evaluated whether activation of these olfactory receptors by a newly developed odorant elicited a similar anti-fatigue effect to Hex-Hex Mix. We assessed anti-fatigue effects with behavioral tests, and 17 healthy males performed the 2-back test as a fatigue-inducing task with or without exposure to the new odorant. Immediately before and after the task, participants performed a cognitive task to evaluate their level of mental fatigue. We found that the difference value of the correct response rate on the cognitive task in the evaluation session was significantly different between in the odorant condition and in the without-odorant condition during the fatigue-inducing session suggesting that the new odorant may improve performance in the fatigue-inducing condition. The results indicated that the new odorant activates the same olfactory receptors as Hex-Hex Mix, which has been reported to induce anti-fatigue effects. Our findings suggest that the olfactory receptors in the olfactory system may be involved in the attenuation of fatigue.</content></content><author><name>Naoko Saito</name></author><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naoko Saito, Emi Yamano, Akira Ishii, Masaaki Tanaka, Junji Nakamura, Yasuyoshi Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling pathways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Annie M.

We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Low serum sodium levels at hospital admission: Outcomes among 2.3 million hospitalized patients</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194379</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123923:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1521752400000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194379</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194379</originId><published>1521752400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>22e04b0f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194379</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Saleem Al Mawed, V.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. Controversies still exist over the relationship between hyponatremia and outcomes of hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To analyze the association of low serum sodium levels at hospital admission with in-hospital mortality and patient disposition and to compare the distribution of the risk of death associated with hyponatremia across the lifespan of hospitalized patients, we conducted an observational study of 2.3 million patients using data extracted from the Cerner Health Facts database between 2000 and 2014. Logistic regression models were used in the analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At hospital admission 14.4% of hospitalized patients had serum sodium levels [Na] &amp;lt;135 mEq/L. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, we found that the risk of in-hospital mortality significantly increases for [Na] levels &amp;lt; 135 or ≥143 to ≤145 mEq/L compared to the reference interval of 140 to &amp;lt;143 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001). We observed similar trends for the relationship between [Na] levels and discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility. We demonstrated that younger age groups (18 to &amp;lt;45, 45 to &amp;lt;65) had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to older age groups (65 to &amp;lt;75, ≥75) for [Na] levels &amp;lt;130 mEq/L or 143 to ≤145 mEq/L (p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hyponatremia is common among hospitalized patients and is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice or to a nursing facility.

Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population genetics processes—notably, by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8BI0l7B3nAc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yuval B.

The presence of low-frequency variants with few mutations with respect to major strains may result in an immune escape, emergence of drug resistance, and an increase of virulence and infectivity. Next-generation sequencing technologies permit detection of sample intra-host viral population at extremely great depth, thus providing an opportunity to access low-frequency variants. Long read lengths offered by single-molecule sequencing technologies allow all viral variants to be sequenced in a single pass. However, high sequencing error rates limit the ability to study heterogeneous viral populations composed of rare, closely related variants. In this article, we present CliqueSNV, a novel reference-based method for reconstruction of viral variants from NGS data. It efficiently constructs an allele graph based on linkage between single nucleotide variations and identifies true viral variants by merging cliques of that graph using combinatorial optimization techniques. The new method outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and running time on experimental and simulated NGS data for titrated levels of known viral variants. For PacBio reads, it accurately reconstructs variants with frequency as low as 0.1%. For Illumina reads, it fully reconstructs main variants.

The presence of low-frequency variants with few mutations with respect to major strains may result in an immune escape, emergence of drug resistance, and an increase of virulence and infectivity. Next-generation sequencing technologies permit detection of sample intra-host viral population at extremely great depth, thus providing an opportunity to access low-frequency variants. Long read lengths offered by single-molecule sequencing technologies allow all viral variants to be sequenced in a single pass.

Light and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition are among the important environmental factors influencing plant growth and forest regeneration. We used &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt;, a dominant broadleaf tree species native to the deciduous forests of Northern China, to study the combined effects of light exposure and N addition on leaf physiology and individual plant growth. In the greenhouse, we exposed &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt; seedlings to one of two light conditions (8% and 80% of full irradiation) and one of three N treatments (0, 6, and 12 g N m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). After 87 d, we observed that nitrogen deposition had no significant effects on the seedlings regardless of light exposure. In addition, shade significantly reduced plant height, basal diameter, leaf number, total biomass, gas exchange capacity, and carbohydrate content. In contrast, however, shade significantly increased the amount of photosynthetic pigment, above-ground biomass allocation, and specific leaf area. There was also a hierarchical plasticity among the different seedling characteristics. Compared to traits of growth, biomass, biomass allocation and leaf morphology, the leaf physiology, including photosynthetic pigment, gas exchange, carbohydrate, and PUNE, is more sensitive to light conditions. Among the biomass allocation parameters, the leaf and root mass ratios had a relatively low phenotypic plasticity. The seedlings had high foliar physiological plasticity under various light conditions. Nevertheless, we recommend high irradiance to maintain vigorous seedling growth and, in turn, promote the restoration and reconstruction of vegetation.</content></content><author><name>Mingyan Li</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mingyan Li, Weihua Guo, Ning Du, Zhenwei Xu, Xiao Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Koshu is indigenous to Japan and considered the most important wine grape in Japan. Koshu grape berry possesses characteristics that make it unique from European &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vinifera&lt;/i&gt; as wine grape. However, the physiological characteristics of Koshu leaf and internode remain unknown. An understanding of those characteristics would contribute to improvements in Koshu cultivation, thereby enhancing grape berry and wine quality. To identify the genes responsible for the physiological characteristics of Koshu, we comprehensively analyzed leaf and internode differences at the transcriptome level between Koshu and Pinot Noir by RNA sequencing. A total of 248 and 131 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in leaves and internodes, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of these DEGs revealed that “flavonoid biosynthesis” and “glutathione metabolism” pathways were significantly enriched in Koshu leaves. On the other hand, when internodes were compared, “flavonoid”-related GO terms were specifically detected in Koshu. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the expression of such genes as &lt;i&gt;leucoanthocyanidin reductase&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;flavonol synthase&lt;/i&gt; in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was higher in Koshu than Pinot Noir. Measurement of the relative expression levels of these genes by RT-qPCR validated the results obtained by RNA sequencing.

Together, these results suggest a model for selective itch via activation of a specialized subpopulation of somatosensory neurons with a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli.</description></item><item><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 12, Page 705-710, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25137?af=R</link><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_16265902e8b:6ce25:76251cdd</id><unread>True</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25137?af=R</originId><published>1522122370699</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>662f15b5</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 12, Page 705-710, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25137?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/12&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, Page 705-710, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1522122370699</crawled></item><item><engagement>21</engagement><title>Oligodendrocytes control potassium accumulation in white matter and seizure susceptibility</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34829</link><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1627281293e:7304c14:34f43e70</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34829</canonicalUrl><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34829</originId><crawled>1522339490110</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><fingerprint>5dae7b03</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel K&lt;sub&gt;ir&lt;/sub&gt;4.1 is broadly expressed by CNS glia and deficits in K&lt;sub&gt;ir&lt;/sub&gt;4.1 lead to seizures and myelin vacuolization.

Side scan sonar in low-cost ‘fishfinder’ systems has become popular in aquatic ecology and sedimentology for imaging submerged riverbed sediment at coverages and resolutions sufficient to relate bed texture to grain-size. Traditional methods to map bed texture (i.e. physical samples) are relatively high-cost and low spatial coverage compared to sonar, which can continuously image several kilometers of channel in a few hours. Towards a goal of automating the classification of bed habitat features, we investigate relationships between substrates and statistical descriptors of bed textures in side scan sonar echograms of alluvial deposits. We develop a method for automated segmentation of bed textures into between two to five grain-size classes. Second-order texture statistics are used in conjunction with a Gaussian Mixture Model to classify the heterogeneous bed into small homogeneous patches of sand, gravel, and boulders with an average accuracy of 80%, 49%, and 61%, respectively. Reach-averaged proportions of these sediment types were within 3% compared to similar maps derived from multibeam sonar.</content></content><author><name>Daniel Hamill</name></author><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Hamill, Daniel Buscombe, Joseph M.

We investigated the numbers of planktonic and biofilm cells and the expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps and biofilm-related proteins in 10 clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; (MDRA) as well as in its standard strain ATCC 19606 in the presence of colistin (CST), polymyxin B (PMB), minomycin (MIN), and tigecycline (TGC) at their respective sub-MICs. The number of planktonic and biofilm cells of ATCC 19606 decreased in the presence of all aforementioned antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner. Cell number also decreased in two representative MDRA strains, R2 and R3, in the presence of MIN and TGC in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the number of biofilm cells in these two strains increased in the presence of CST, while they increased significantly in the presence of PMB in R2 only. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the number of biofilm cells was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding efflux pumps (&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;) and autoinducer synthase (&lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt;) in strain R2 and &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeJ&lt;/i&gt;, poly-acetyl-glucosamine-porin (&lt;i&gt;pgaA&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of CST.

Haploid laboratory strains of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; are commonly used for genetic engineering to enable their xylose utilization but little is known about the industrial yeast which is often recognized as diploid and as well as haploid and tetraploid. Here we report three unique signature pathway expression patterns and gene interactions in the centre metabolic pathways that signify xylose utilization of genetically engineered industrial yeast &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; NRRL Y-50463, a diploid yeast. Quantitative expression analysis revealed outstanding high levels of constitutive expression of &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt;, a synthesized yeast codon-optimized xylose isomerase gene integrated into chromosome XV of strain Y-50463. Comparative expression analysis indicated that the &lt;i&gt;YXI&lt;/i&gt; was necessary to initiate the xylose metabolic pathway along with a set of heterologous xylose transporter and utilization facilitating genes including &lt;i&gt;XUT4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;XUT6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;XKS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;XYL2&lt;/i&gt;.

The significantly increased expression of the entire &lt;i&gt;PRS&lt;/i&gt; gene family facilitates functions of the life cycle and biosynthesis superpathway for the yeast.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Children with chronic health conditions may perform poorer at school. Associations may be confounded by numerous social factors. We aimed to estimate the effects of a chronic health condition on overall school performance in first graders with an emphasis on rigorous adjustment for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A population-based cohort study was performed in the area of Mainz-Bingen (Germany). In 2015 all preschoolers were approached and the presence of a chronic health condition was assessed by parental questionnaires and preschool health examination data. The identification of a chronic health condition was based on special health care needs and presence of a doctor’s diagnosis out of 24 school-relevant diseases. At the end of the first school year, overall school performance was assessed by teachers and rated on a 5-item scale ranging from -10 to +10.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 3683 children approached, 2003 were enrolled. Overall school performance was available for 1462 children (51% boys). Of these, 52% suffered from a chronic health condition. Compared to children without a chronic health condition, children with special health care needs (15%) performed worse at school (adjusted mean difference: -0.95, 95% CI: [-1.55; -0.35], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). Children with a doctor’s diagnosis but without special health care needs (37%) did not perform worse at school. The effect was further analysed considering the extent of special health care needed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Chronic health conditions affect overall school performance early in primary school.

Changes in pathogen genetic variation within hosts alter the severity and spread of infectious diseases, with important implications for clinical disease and public health. Genetic drift may play a strong role in shaping pathogen variation, but analyses of drift in pathogens have oversimplified pathogen population dynamics, either by considering dynamics only at a single scale—such as within hosts or between hosts—or by making drastic simplifying assumptions, for example, that host immune systems can be ignored or that transmission bottlenecks are complete. Moreover, previous studies have used genetic data to infer the strength of genetic drift, whereas we test whether the genetic drift imposed by pathogen population processes can be used to explain genetic data. We first constructed and parameterized a mathematical model of gypsy moth baculovirus dynamics that allows genetic drift to act within and between hosts. We then quantified the genome-wide diversity of baculovirus populations within each of 143 field-collected gypsy moth larvae using Illumina sequencing. Finally, we determined whether the genetic drift imposed by host–pathogen population dynamics in our model explains the levels of pathogen diversity in our data. We found that when the model allows drift to act at multiple scales—including within hosts, between hosts, and between years—it can accurately reproduce the data, but when the effects of drift are simplified by neglecting transmission bottlenecks and stochastic variation in virus replication within hosts, the model fails. A de novo mutation model and a purifying selection model similarly fail to explain the data. Our results show that genetic drift can play a strong role in determining pathogen variation and that mathematical models that account for pathogen population growth at multiple scales of biological organization can be used to explain this variation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bmOg3KEZQRc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>David A.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by virtually every cell of all organisms are involved in processes of intercellular communication through the delivery of their functional mRNAs, proteins and bioactive lipids. We previously demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem cell-released EVs (mESEVs) are able to transfer their content to different target retinal cells, inducing morphological and biochemical changes in them. The main objective of this paper is to characterize EVs derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESEVs) and investigate the effects that they have on cultured retinal glial, progenitor Müller cells, which are known to give rise to retinal neurons under specific conditions. This would allow us to establish if hESEVs have a pro-regenerative potential not yet described that could be used in the future for treatment of human retinal degenerative diseases. Initially, we showed that hESEVs are heterogeneous in size, contain mRNAs and proteins involved in the induction and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency and can be internalized by cultured Müller cells. After a single exposure to hESEVs these cells display changes in their gene expression profile, and with multiple exposures they de-differentiate and trans-differentiate into retinal neuronal precursors. hESEVs were then fractionated into microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (EXOs), which were characterized by size, specific surface proteins and biochemical/molecular components. We demonstrate that despite the similar internalization of non-fractionated hESEVs, MVs and EXOs by Müller progenitor cells, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, only the release of MVs’ cargo into the cells’ cytoplasm induces specific changes in their levels of pluripotency mRNAs and early retinal proteins. EXOs do not produce any detectable effect. Thus, we conclude that MVs and MVs-containing hESEVs are promising agents that possibly could promote the regeneration of diseased or damaged retinas &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; through inducing glial Müller cells to become replacement neurons.</content></content><author><name>Yingqian Peng</name></author><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yingqian Peng, Edouard Baulier, Yifeng Ke, Alejandra Young, Novruz B.

Thus, we conclude that MVs and MVs-containing hESEVs are promising agents that possibly could promote the regeneration of diseased or damaged retinas &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; through inducing glial Müller cells to become replacement neurons.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Stochastic vagus nerve stimulation affects acute heart rate dynamics in rats</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194910</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4249:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194910</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194910</originId><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>639419c9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194910</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Steven W.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved therapy for treatment of epilepsy and depression. While also shown to be promising in several preclinical and clinical studies to treat cardiovascular diseases, optimal therapeutic stimulation paradigms are still under investigation. Traditionally, parameters such as frequency, current, and duty cycle are used to adjust the efficacy of VNS therapy. This study explored the effect of novel stochastic VNS (S-VNS) on acute heart rate (HR) dynamics. The effect of S-VNS was evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats by comparing the acute HR and HR variability (HRV) responses to standard, periodic VNS (P-VNS) across different frequencies (FREQs, 10–30 Hz). Our results demonstrate that both S-VNS and P-VNS produced negative chronotropic effects in a FREQ-dependent manner with S-VNS inducing a significantly smaller drop in HR at 10 Hz and 20 Hz compared to P-VNS (p&amp;lt;0.05). S-VNS demonstrated a FREQ-dependent drop in the SD1/SD2 ratio, a measure of HRV, which was absent in P-VNS, suggesting that S-VNS may acutely modulate the nonlinear relationship between short- and long-term HRV. In conclusion, S-VNS is a novel stimulation procedure that may provide different physiological outcomes from standard P-VNS, as indicated by our analysis of HR dynamics. Our study provides a rationale for further detailed investigations into the therapeutic potential of S-VNS as a novel neuromodulation technique.</content></content><author><name>Steven W.

Background &lt;p&gt;In patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction is frequent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis seems to be linked to autonomic dysfunction.

The exclusion criterion was presence of cardiac diseases, independent of liver cirrhosis. Biochemical parameters were analysed using standard methods. HRT was assessed using Turbulence onset (TO) and slope (TS). The endpoint was deterioration of liver cirrhosis defined as increased MELD and readmission for complications of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 122 cirrhotic patients, 82 patients (63% male) with median Child score of 6 (range 5–12) and median MELD score of 10 (range 6–32) were included. Increasing Child score, INR and decreasing albumin were correlated with TO. In addition, decompensated patients with ascites showed more abnormal TO and TS. During the observation period, patients with more abnormal TO showed significantly higher rate of rising MELD Score at 6 months (p = 0.03). Nevertheless, at least in our collective HRT-parameters were not independent predictors of deterioration of cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Parameters of HRT are closely associated with deterioration of cirrhosis and might be helpful in its prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Christian Jansen</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Jansen, Baravan Al-Kassou, Jennifer Lehmann, Alessandra Pohlmann, Johannes Chang, Michael Praktiknjo, Georg Nickenig, Christian P.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to construct a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for measuring self-care performance (the CAT-SC) in children with developmental disabilities (DD) aged from 6 months to 12 years in a content-inclusive, precise, and efficient fashion.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was divided into 3 phases: (1) item bank development, (2) item testing, and (3) a simulation study to determine the stopping rules for the administration of the CAT-SC. A total of 215 caregivers of children with DD were interviewed with the 73-item CAT-SC item bank. An item response theory model was adopted for examining the construct validity to estimate item parameters after investigation of the unidimensionality, equality of slope parameters, item fitness, and differential item functioning (DIF). In the last phase, the reliability and concurrent validity of the CAT-SC were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The final CAT-SC item bank contained 56 items. The stopping rules suggested were (a) reliability coefficient greater than 0.9 or (b) 14 items administered. The results of simulation also showed that 85% of the estimated self-care performance scores would reach a reliability higher than 0.9 with a mean test length of 8.5 items, and the mean reliability for the rest was 0.86. Administering the CAT-SC could reduce the number of items administered by 75% to 84%. In addition, self-care performances estimated by the CAT-SC and the full item bank were very similar to each other (Pearson &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.98).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The newly developed CAT-SC can efficiently measure self-care performance in children with DD whose performances are comparable to those of TD children aged from 6 months to 12 years as precisely as the whole item bank. The item bank of the CAT-SC has good reliability and a unidimensional self-care construct, and the CAT can estimate self-care performance with less than 25% of the items in the item bank.

The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) illumination for more than 1500 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>355</engagement><title>Protecting marine mammals, turtles, and birds by rebuilding global fisheries</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1255?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d25118:9f3b30f2</id><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/1255.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1255?rss=1</originId><published>1521135592000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Ecology</item></keywords><fingerprint>6488acdd</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1255?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Reductions in global fishing pressure are needed to end overfishing of target species and maximize the value of fisheries.

Background &lt;p&gt;Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides.

In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases).

Medulloblastoma (MB), the tumor of the cerebellum, is the most frequent brain cancer in childhood and a major cause of pediatric mortality. Based on gene profiling, four MB subgroups have been identified, i.e., Wnt or Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) types, and subgroup 3 or 4. The Shh-type MB has been shown to arise from the cerebellar precursors of granule neurons (GCPs), where a hyperactivation of the Shh pathway leads to their neoplastic transformation. We have previously shown that the gene &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PC3&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Btg2&lt;/i&gt;) inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation and migration of GCPs. Moreover, the overexpression or the deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, a model of spontaneous Shh-type MB, highly reduces or increases, respectively, the frequency of MB. Here we tested whether Tis21 can inhibit MB allografts. Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously grafted with MB cells explanted from &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. MB allografts were then injected with adeno-associated viruses either carrying &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;) or empty (AAV-CBA). We observed that the treatment with AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; significantly inhibited the growth of tumor nodules, as judged by their volume, and reduced the number of proliferating tumor cells (labeled with Ki67 or BrdU), relative to AAV-CBA-treated control mice. In parallel, AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; increased significantly tumor cells labeled with early and late neural differentiation markers. Overall the results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;-gene therapy slows down MB tumor growth through inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neural differentiation.

Based on gene profiling, four MB subgroups have been identified, i.e., Wnt or Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) types, and subgroup 3 or 4. The Shh-type MB has been shown to arise from the cerebellar precursors of granule neurons (GCPs), where a hyperactivation of the Shh pathway leads to their neoplastic transformation. We have previously shown that the gene &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PC3&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Btg2&lt;/i&gt;) inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation and migration of GCPs. Moreover, the overexpression or the deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, a model of spontaneous Shh-type MB, highly reduces or increases, respectively, the frequency of MB. Here we tested whether Tis21 can inhibit MB allografts. Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously grafted with MB cells explanted from &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. MB allografts were then injected with adeno-associated viruses either carrying &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;) or empty (AAV-CBA). We observed that the treatment with AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; significantly inhibited the growth of tumor nodules, as judged by their volume, and reduced the number of proliferating tumor cells (labeled with Ki67 or BrdU), relative to AAV-CBA-treated control mice. In parallel, AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; increased significantly tumor cells labeled with early and late neural differentiation markers. Overall the results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;-gene therapy slows down MB tumor growth through inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neural differentiation. These results validate &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; as a relevant target for MB therapy.</description></item><item><engagement>7871</engagement><title>Fourier’s transformational thinking</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03389-w</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16243599654:2deab1b:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03389-w/d41586-018-03389-w_15548124.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03389-w</originId><published>1521529200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ba14969b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03389-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fourier’s transformational thinking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourier’s transformational thinking, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03389-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03389-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The mathematics of Joseph Fourier, born 250 years ago this week, shows the value of intellectual boldness.</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1521548367444</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fourier’s transformational thinking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourier’s transformational thinking, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03389-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03389-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The mathematics of Joseph Fourier, born 250 years ago this week, shows the value of intellectual boldness.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>LHCSR1-dependent fluorescence quenching is mediated by excitation energy transfer from LHCII to photosystem I in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [Plant Biology]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3722.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1628cac297a:9554b7b:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3722</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3722.short?rss=1</originId><published>1522774666000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>dda87880</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3722.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Photosynthetic organisms are frequently exposed to light intensities that surpass the photosynthetic electron transport capacity.

We report on a universal sample-independent sensorless adaptive optics method, based on modal optimization of the second moment of the fluorescence emission from a point-like excitation. Our method employs a sample-independent precalibration, performed only once for the particular system, to establish the direct relation between the image quality and the aberration. The method is potentially applicable to any form of microscopy with epifluorescence detection, including the practically important case of incoherent fluorescence emission from a three dimensional object, through minor hardware modifications.

The PgdS enzyme is a poly-γ-glutamic (γ-PGA) hydrolase, which has potential application for a controllable degradation of γ-PGA by enzymatic depolymerization; however, the structure of PgdS is still unknown. Here, to study in detail the full-length PgdS structure, we analyze the low-resolution architecture of PgdS hydrolase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; in solution using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) method. Combining with other methods, like dynamic light scattering and mutagenesis analyses, a model for the full length structure and the possible substrate delivery route of PgdS are proposed. The results will provide useful hints for future investigations into the mechanisms of γ-PGA degradation by the PgdS hydrolase and may provide valuable practical information.</content></content><author><name>Jumei Zeng</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jumei Zeng, Yun Jin, Zhongchuan Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding how neurons cooperate to integrate sensory inputs and guide behavior is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction (HD) system, we present evidence demonstrating how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised Machine Learning tool, can learn the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. We show how the method, unlike linear analysis, reveals that the coordination in thalamo-cortical circuits is qualitatively the same during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine Learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eLys5LrtLXM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Guillaume Viejo</name></author><crawled>1521740722341</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Viejo, Thomas Cortier, Adrien Peyrache&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, our proposed method, summary statistic imputation without performing variance re-weighting, fully accounts for imputation uncertainty while achieving better power.</description></item><item><engagement>8</engagement><title>Female leadership falls at top universities</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1628fb05173:99aab6e:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6</originId><published>1522825200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><fingerprint>7f541cac</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Female leadership falls at top universities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female leadership falls at top universities, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03927-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Decline in number of female presidents since last year underscores concerns about lack of female role models and advocacy.</content></content><engagementRate>0.01</engagementRate><crawled>1522829119859</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Female leadership falls at top universities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female leadership falls at top universities, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03927-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03927-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Decline in number of female presidents since last year underscores concerns about lack of female role models and advocacy.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006034</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Integrative single-cell omics analyses reveal epigenetic heterogeneity in mouse embryonic stem cells</title><recrawled>1521663840899</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006034</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16249acad20:40279:a077e55f</id><updated>1521666000000</updated><unread>False</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006034</originId><published>1521666000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><fingerprint>93f4e9e9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/f7Po2bpx1o8/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yanting Luo, Jianlin He, Xiguang Xu, Ming-an Sun, Xiaowei Wu, Xuemei Lu, Hehuang Xie&lt;/p&gt;
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) consist of a population of self-renewing cells displaying extensive phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Research towards the understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity among ESCs is still in its initial stage. Key issues, such as how to identify cell-subset specifically methylated loci and how to interpret the biological meanings of methylation variations remain largely unexplored. To fill in the research gap, we implemented a computational pipeline to analyze single-cell methylome and to perform an integrative analysis with single-cell transcriptome data. According to the origins of variation in DNA methylation, we determined the genomic loci associated with allelic-specific methylation or asymmetric DNA methylation, and explored a beta mixture model to infer the genomic loci exhibiting cell-subset specific methylation (CSM). We observed that the putative CSM loci in ESCs are significantly enriched in CpG island (CGI) shelves and regions with histone marks for promoter and enhancer, and the genes hosting putative CSM loci show wide-ranging expression among ESCs. More interestingly, the putative CSM loci may be clustered into co-methylated modules enriching the binding motifs of distinct sets of transcription factors. Taken together, our study provided a novel tool to explore single-cell methylome and transcriptome to reveal the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks associated with epigenetic heterogeneity of ESCs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f7Po2bpx1o8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yanting Luo</name></author><crawled>1521654476064</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanting Luo, Jianlin He, Xiguang Xu, Ming-an Sun, Xiaowei Wu, Xuemei Lu, Hehuang Xie&lt;/p&gt;

Using in-field bioreactors, we investigated the influence of exogenous microorganisms in groundwater planktonic and biofilm microbial communities as part of the Integrated Field Research Challenge (IFRC). After an acclimation period with source groundwater, bioreactors received either filtered (0.22 μM filter) or unfiltered well groundwater in triplicate and communities were tracked routinely for 23 days after filtration was initiated. To address geochemical influences, the planktonic phase was assayed periodically for protein, organic acids, physico-/geochemical measurements and bacterial community (via 16S rRNA gene sequencing), while biofilms (i.e. microbial growth on sediment coupons) were targeted for bacterial community composition at the completion of the experiment (23 d). Based on Bray-Curtis distance, planktonic bacterial community composition varied temporally and between treatments (filtered, unfiltered bioreactors). Notably, filtration led to an increase in the dominant genus, &lt;i&gt;Zoogloea&lt;/i&gt; relative abundance over time within the planktonic community, while remaining relatively constant when unfiltered. At day 23, biofilm communities were more taxonomically and phylogenetically diverse and substantially different from planktonic bacterial communities; however, the biofilm bacterial communities were similar regardless of filtration. These results suggest that although planktonic communities were sensitive to groundwater filtration, bacterial biofilm communities were stable and resistant to filtration. Bioreactors are useful tools in addressing questions pertaining to microbial community assembly and succession. These data provide a first step in understanding how an extrinsic factor, such as a groundwater inoculation and flux of microbial colonizers, impact how microbial communities assemble in environmental systems.</content></content><author><name>Geoff A.

Rotavirus is a common cause of diarrhea worldwide, and vaccination prevents rotaviral gastroenteritis. Since the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in Korea in 2007, the prevalence of rotaviral gastroenteritis has decreased. However, little is known on the economic burden of rotavirus infection and its variations in Korea. Here, we estimated the economic costs of rotavirus infection from 2009 to 2012 using nationwide data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) claims. Socioeconomic costs were subdivided into direct and indirect and measured with a prevalence-based approach. Costs were converted from Won to United States dollars (US$). The number of children &amp;lt;5years old infected with rotavirus decreased from 21,437 to 10,295 during the study period, representing a decrease in prevalence from 947 to 443 per 100,000. The sum of direct and indirect costs also decreased, from $17.3 million to $9.6 million, and the days of admission decreased from 76,000 to 38,000. However, per capita expenditures slightly increased, from $809 to $934. Thus, the economic burden of rotavirus infection decreased after implementation of rotavirus vaccination. Including the vaccine as part of the national essential vaccination program could reduce the prevalence of and economic loss from rotavirus infection in Korea.</content></content><author><name>Kyung Suk Lee</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kyung Suk Lee, Ye-Rin Lee, So-Youn Park, In-Hwan Oh&lt;/p&gt;

DNA methylation is mediated by a conserved family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). The human genome encodes three active Dnmts (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b), the tRNA methyltransferase Dnmt2, and the regulatory protein Dnmt3L. Despite their high degree of conservation among different species, genes encoding Dnmts have been duplicated and/or lost in multiple lineages throughout evolution, indicating that the DNA methylation machinery has some potential to undergo evolutionary change. However, little is known about the extent to which this machinery, or the methylome, varies among vertebrates. Here, we study the molecular evolution of Dnmt1, the enzyme responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation patterns after replication, in 79 vertebrate species. Our analyses show that all studied species exhibit a single copy of the &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; gene, with the exception of tilapia and marsupials (tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil and opossum), each of which displays two apparently functional &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; duplicated before the radiation of major marsupial groups (i.e., at least ~75 million years ago), thus giving rise to two &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies in marsupials (copy 1 and copy 2). In the opossum lineage, copy 2 was lost, and copy 1 recently duplicated again, generating three &lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies: two putatively functional genes (copy 1a and 1b) and one pseudogene (copy 1ψ). Both marsupial copies (&lt;i&gt;DNMT1&lt;/i&gt; copies 1 and 2) are under purifying selection, and copy 2 exhibits elevated rates of evolution and signatures of positive selection, suggesting a scenario of neofunctionalization. This gene duplication might have resulted in modifications in marsupial methylomes and their dynamics.</content></content><author><name>David Alvarez-Ponce</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Alvarez-Ponce, María Torres-Sánchez, Felix Feyertag, Asmita Kulkarni, Taylen Nappi&lt;/p&gt;

This study explores the association between specific insomnia symptoms (sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakenings symptoms) and self-efficacy (perceived self-confidence in the ability to use CPAP) with CPAP compliance in French patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of CPAP compliance in a cohort of 404 patients diagnosed with OSAS. Patients completed mailed questionnaires on sleepiness (ESS), insomnia (ISI) and self-efficacy in sleep apnea (SEMSA). Linear regression modeling analyses were performed to explore the impact of measured variables on the number of hours of CPAP use. Of the initial pool of 404 patients, 288 returned the questionnaires (71% response rate). Their mean age was 63.16±12.73 yrs, 31% were females, mean BMI was 30.39±6.31 kg/m2, mean daily CPAP use was 6.19±2.03 h, mean number of years of use was 6.58±6.03 yrs, and mean initial AHI before CPAP use was 34.61±20.71 /h. Age (p&amp;lt;0.01), BMI (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep onset insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01), sleep maintenance insomnia symptoms (p&amp;lt;0.01) and self-efficacy (p&amp;lt;0.01) were significantly associated with mean daily CPAP use.

There has been an increasing realisation that young infants are exposed to elevated concentrations of the carcinogen inorganic arsenic, relative to adults. This is because many infant food products are rice based, and rice is ~10-fold elevated in inorganic arsenic compared to most other foods. The European Commission (EC) has acted on this concern setting stricter standards for infants, 100 μg of inorganic arsenic per kg of food (100 μg/kg), as compared to adults (200 μg/kg), for rice based foods, a law that was brought into place in 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2016. Here we investigate how this law has impacted on inorganic arsenic in baby food products in the UK market, and compare the findings to previous baby food surveys taken before and just after the law came into place. We find that for a wide range of UK infant products that the new regulations are being adhered to, with all samples surveyed, being under 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic. The prevalence of pure rice products had decreased in the UK, and there appears to be careful sourcing of the rice used in these products to ensure conformity with regulations. There has been an increased presence of mixed cereal products, with rice and maize as the main ingredient, appearing on the UK market, with varying rice contents for infant porridges, cakes and mueslis, with the latter being a relatively innovative product for infant foods. There was a highly significant correlation (P&amp;lt;0.0001) between rice content and inorganic arsenic concentration across all infant foods. When UK infant rice cakes, breakfast cereals and porridges were compare to their general, i.e. not labelled specifically for being for infant consumption, equivalent it was found that the adult foods generally exceeded the 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic standard for infant foods. Thus, infants should not be given rice products not specifically labelled as being for them if a lower inorganic arsenic diet is to be maintained.</content></content><author><name>Manus Carey</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Manus Carey, Emily Donaldson, Antonio J.

Here we investigate how this law has impacted on inorganic arsenic in baby food products in the UK market, and compare the findings to previous baby food surveys taken before and just after the law came into place. We find that for a wide range of UK infant products that the new regulations are being adhered to, with all samples surveyed, being under 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic. The prevalence of pure rice products had decreased in the UK, and there appears to be careful sourcing of the rice used in these products to ensure conformity with regulations. There has been an increased presence of mixed cereal products, with rice and maize as the main ingredient, appearing on the UK market, with varying rice contents for infant porridges, cakes and mueslis, with the latter being a relatively innovative product for infant foods. There was a highly significant correlation (P&amp;lt;0.0001) between rice content and inorganic arsenic concentration across all infant foods. When UK infant rice cakes, breakfast cereals and porridges were compare to their general, i.e. not labelled specifically for being for infant consumption, equivalent it was found that the adult foods generally exceeded the 100 μg/kg inorganic arsenic standard for infant foods. Thus, infants should not be given rice products not specifically labelled as being for them if a lower inorganic arsenic diet is to be maintained.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Graphic cigarette pack warnings do not produce more negative implicit evaluations of smoking compared to text-only warnings</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194627</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a62e:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1521147600000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194627</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194627</originId><published>1521147600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>15d944d9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194627</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pieter Van Dessel, Colin Tucker Smith, Jan De Houwer&lt;/p&gt;
Graphic warnings (GWs) on cigarette packs are widely used internationally with the aim of reducing smoking behavior. In the current study, we investigated whether GWs influence implicit evaluations of smoking, a potential moderator of smoking behavior, as measured with an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Results showed that viewing a GW did not produce more negative implicit evaluations of smoking for daily smokers, occasional smokers, or non-smokers, compared to viewing a text-only warning. If anything, effects were in the direction of evaluations of smoking being &lt;i&gt;more positive&lt;/i&gt; after certain participants (i.e., daily and occasional smokers) viewed a GW. We also did not find any beneficial effects of GWs on explicit evaluations of smoking. These results contrast with the observation that non-smokers and occasional smokers (but not daily smokers) believed that GWs would be more effective than the text-only warnings. We discuss implications and limitations of these findings and provide recommendations for improving the effectiveness of cigarette pack warnings on implicit evaluations.</content></content><author><name>Pieter Van Dessel</name></author><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pieter Van Dessel, Colin Tucker Smith, Jan De Houwer&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Demographic change has led to an increase of older people in need of long-term care in nearly all European countries. Informal carers primarily provide the care and support needed by dependent people. The supply and willingness of individuals to act as carers are critical to sustain informal care resources as part of the home health care provision. This paper describes a longitudinal study of informal care in six European countries and reports analyses that determine those factors predicting the outcomes of family care over a one-year period.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Analyses are based on data from the EUROFAMCARE project, a longitudinal survey study of family carers of older people with baseline data collection in 2004 and follow-up data collection a year later in six European countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), N = 3,348. Descriptive statistics of the sample characteristics are reported. Binary logistic random-intercept regressions were computed, predicting the outcome of change of the care dyad’s status at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Where care is provided by a more distant family member or by a friend or neighbour, the care-recipient is significantly more likely to be cared for by someone else (OR 1.62) or to be in residential care (OR 3.37) after one year. The same holds true if the care-recipient has memory problems with a dementia diagnosis (OR 1.79/OR 1.84). Higher dependency (OR 1.22) and behavioural problems (OR 1.76) in the care-recipient also lead to a change of care dyad status. Country of residence explained a relatively small amount of variance (8%) in whether a care-recipient was cared for by someone else after one year, but explained a substantial amount of variance (52%) in whether a care-recipient was in residential care. Particularly in Sweden, care-recipients are much more likely to be cared for by another family or professional carer or to be in residential care, whereas in Greece the status of the care dyad is much less likely to change.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The majority of family carers continued to provide care to their respective older relatives over a one-year period, despite often high levels of functional, cognitive and behavioural problems in the care-recipient. Those family carers could benefit most from appropriate support. The carer/care-recipient relationship plays an important role in whether or not a family care dyad remains intact over a one-year period. The support of health and social care services should be particularly targeted toward those care dyads where there is no partner or spouse acting as carer, or no extended family network that might absorb the caring role when required. Distant relatives, friends or acquaintances who are acting as carers might need substantial intervention if their caregiving role is to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Daniel Lüdecke</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Lüdecke, Barbara Bien, Kevin McKee, Barbro Krevers, Elizabeth Mestheneos, Mirko Di Rosa, Olaf von dem Knesebeck, Christopher Kofahl&lt;/p&gt;

To move a hard table together, humans may coordinate by following the dominant partner’s motion [1–4], but this strategy is unsuitable for a soft mattress where the perceived forces are small. How do partners readily coordinate in such differing interaction dynamics? To address this, we investigated how pairs tracked a target using flexion-extension of their wrists, which were coupled by a hard, medium or soft virtual elastic band. Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, who had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled partner’s muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one’s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information. This model elucidates the versatile mechanism by which humans can coordinate during both hard and soft physical interactions to ensure maximum performance with minimal effort.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bXD1PWYahz8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Atsushi Takagi</name></author><crawled>1521740722341</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atsushi Takagi, Francesco Usai, Gowrishankar Ganesh, Vittorio Sanguineti, Etienne Burdet&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used as disease modifying treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Rheumatological and dermatological guidelines to prevent MTX-induced adverse events diverge in the number and frequency of blood tests. These differences are not based on evidence indicating a higher risk for patients with psoriasis compared to PsA or rheumatic arthritis (RA). This raises the question if multiple testing increases safety, or results in false positive signals potentially leading to early withdrawal of an effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;Compare the effects of MTX monitoring strategies by rheumatologists and dermatologists regarding drug survival, reasons for withdrawal and safety.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective follow-up of all patients diagnosed with psoriasis by dermatologists or PsA by rheumatologists. Included were consecutive patients who started methotrexate (MTX) between 2006 and 2012 and had a scheduled follow-up by dermatologist or rheumatologist. Exclusions were: drug not started after the first prescription or incomplete availability of lab data. Data were extracted from electronic records: start and stop dates and dosing of MTX; treatment with folic acid and dose; reasons for withdrawal of MTX; numbers of blood sampling and types of laboratory tests performed for MTX safety; number of abnormal tests; occurrence of any serious adverse event (SAE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;190 Psoriasis and 196 PsA patients starting methotrexate (MTX) were included. Age and sex were comparable. PsA patients used higher initial and maximum doses of MTX and folic acid, but psoriasis patients had a higher frequency of abnormal laboratory results (0.14 vs 0.03 per treatment month, p&amp;lt;0.001), resulting in a striking difference in withdrawal of MTX for abnormal liver enzymes (15.8% vs 3.6%, p&amp;lt;0.001). In PsA patients MTX was withdrawn less frequently for ineffectiveness (15.8 vs 24.2%, p&amp;lt;0.05) leading to longer drug survival in the first course of treatment (37.4±30 vs 18.8±19.1 months). Repeated courses of MTX were more often prescribed by rheumatologists than by dermatologists. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of SAE (psoriasis 0.0041 vs PsA 0.0038 per treatment month) or death (1.6% vs 2.0%) between these groups. Hospital admissions related to infection were recorded in 6 (3.1%) PsA vs 4 (2.1%) psoriasis patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Strict monitoring by dermatologists resulted in more abnormal findings, which reduced drug survival of MTX. The limited monitoring strategy by rheumatologists was not associated with more SAEs. Further research in other populations is needed to confirm whether reduced intensity of monitoring can optimize the use of MTX with sufficient long-term safety.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Felien T.

Late-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment in the elderly with a complex etiology. The most important non-modifiable risk factors for onset and progression of late AMD are age and genetic risk factors, however, little is known about the interplay between genetics and age or sex. Here, we conducted a large-scale age- and sex-stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 1000 Genomes imputed genome-wide and ExomeChip data (&gt;12 million variants). The data were established by the International Age-related Macular Degeneration Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC) from 16,144 late AMD cases and 17,832 controls. Our systematic search for interaction effects yielded significantly stronger effects among younger individuals at two known AMD loci (near &lt;i&gt;CFH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ARMS2/HTRA1&lt;/i&gt;). Accounting for age and gene-age interaction using a joint test identified two additional AMD loci compared to the previous main effect scan. One of these two is a novel AMD GWAS locus, near the retinal clusterin-like protein (&lt;i&gt;CLUL1&lt;/i&gt;) gene, and the other, near the retinaldehyde binding protein 1 (&lt;i&gt;RLBP1&lt;/i&gt;), was recently identified in a joint analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial variants. Despite considerable power in our data, neither sex-dependent effects nor effects with opposite directions between younger and older individuals were observed. This is the first genome-wide interaction study to incorporate age, sex and their interaction with genetic effects for late AMD. Results diminish the potential for a role of sex in the etiology of late AMD yet highlight the importance and existence of age-dependent genetic effects.</content></content><author><name>Thomas W.

Sepsis is characterized by an intense systemic inflammatory response activating a cascade of proinflammatory events resulting in leukocyte dysregulation and host tissue damage. The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic inflammation, leading to acute lung injury. Key to inflammation-induced lung damage is the excessive migration of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium. The mechanisms which regulate neutrophil activation and migration in sepsis are not well defined but there is growing evidence that platelets are actively involved and play a key role in microvascular permeability and neutrophil-mediated organ damage. We previously identified PKC-delta (PKCδ) as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis and demonstrated PKCδ inhibition was lung protective. However, the role of PKCδ in sepsis-induced platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions is not known. In this study, rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Following surgeries, a PKCδ inhibitor (200μg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered intra-tracheally. At 24 hours post-surgeries, lung tissue, BAL fluid, and blood samples were collected. While sepsis caused thrombocytopenia, the remaining circulating platelets were activated as demonstrated by increased p-selectin expression, elevated plasma PF4, and enhanced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation compared to Sham animals. Platelet activation was associated with increased platelet PKCδ activity. Inhibition of PKCδ attenuated sepsis-induced platelet activation, secretion and aggregate formation. Sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia was also significantly reduced and circulating platelet numbers were similar to sham animals. In the lung, sepsis induced significant influx of platelets and neutrophils and the development of lung injury. Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective. Thus, PKCδ inhibition modulated platelet activity both locally and systemically, decreased neutrophil influx into the lung, and was lung protective. We demonstrate for the first time that PKCδ plays an important role in platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil interaction during sepsis.</content></content><author><name>Elisabetta Liverani</name></author><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elisabetta Liverani, Mark J.

In the lung, sepsis induced significant influx of platelets and neutrophils and the development of lung injury. Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective. Thus, PKCδ inhibition modulated platelet activity both locally and systemically, decreased neutrophil influx into the lung, and was lung protective. We demonstrate for the first time that PKCδ plays an important role in platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil interaction during sepsis.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Structural basis for the alternating access mechanism of the cation diffusion facilitator YiiP [Biophysics and Computational Biology]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3042.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6c9:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3042</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3042.short?rss=1</originId><published>1521567125000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9279d3ee</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3042.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>YiiP is a dimeric antiporter from the cation diffusion facilitator family that uses the proton motive force to transport Zn2+ across bacterial membranes.

One of the more fundamental health policy questions is the relationship between health care quality and spending. A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46). Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures.</content></content><author><name>Farah Rahman</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farah Rahman, Jun Guan, Richard H.

In face-to-face social interactions, blind and visually impaired persons (VIPs) lack access to nonverbal cues like facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, which may lead to impaired interpersonal communication. In this study, a wearable sensory substitution device (SSD) consisting of a head mounted camera and a haptic belt was evaluated to determine whether vibrotactile cues around the waist could be used to convey facial expressions to users and whether such a device is desired by VIPs for use in daily living situations. Ten VIPs (mean age: 38.8, SD: 14.4) and 10 sighted persons (SPs) (mean age: 44.5, SD: 19.6) participated in the study, in which validated sets of pictures, silent videos, and videos with audio of facial expressions were presented to the participant. A control measurement was first performed to determine how accurately participants could identify facial expressions while relying on their functional senses. After a short training, participants were asked to determine facial expressions while wearing the emotion feedback system. VIPs using the device showed significant improvements in their ability to determine which facial expressions were shown. A significant increase in accuracy of 44.4% was found across all types of stimuli when comparing the scores of the control (mean±SEM: 35.0±2.5%) and supported (mean±SEM: 79.4±2.1%) phases. The greatest improvements achieved with the support of the SSD were found for silent stimuli (68.3% for pictures and 50.8% for silent videos). SPs also showed consistent, though not statistically significant, improvements while supported. Overall, our study shows that vibrotactile cues are well suited to convey facial expressions to VIPs in real-time. Participants became skilled with the device after a short training session. Further testing and development of the SSD is required to improve its accuracy and aesthetics for potential daily use.</content></content><author><name>Hendrik P.

Recent studies have suggested that proficient bilinguals show morphological decomposition in the L2, but the question remains as to whether this process is modulated by the cognateness of the morphemic constituents of L2 words and by L2 proficiency. To answer this question was the main goal of the present research. For that purpose, a masked priming lexical decision task was conducted manipulating for the first time the degree of orthographic overlap of the L2 word as a whole, as well as of their morphemic constituents (bases and suffixes). Thirty-four European Portuguese-English bilinguals (16 intermediate and 18 high-proficient) and 16 English native-speaking controls performed the task in English. Results revealed that both groups of bilinguals decomposed words as the native control group. Importantly, results also showed that morphological priming effects were sensitive not only to cross-language similarities of words as a whole, but also to their morphemic constituents (especially, suffixes).</content></content><author><name>Montserrat Comesaña</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Montserrat Comesaña, Pauline Bertin, Helena Oliveira, Ana Paula Soares, Juan Andrés Hernández-Cabrera, Séverine Casalis&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Access to medicines without prescription is a major contributing factor for self-medication practices. This study was designed to examine the ratio of non-prescribed medicines sales and self-medication practices in Punjab, Pakistan. This study also evaluates the reasons for self-medication within its communities.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An observational study was conducted in 272 systemically selected pharmacies to analyze medicines-related sales, with or without prescription. A cross-sectional survey was performed between June 2015 and November 2016. Consumers were interviewed about their self-medication practices.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the pharmacies surveyed, 65.3% participated in the study. A total of 4348 medicines were purchased for self-medication by 3037 consumers (15.2% of all study participants), of which 873 (28.7%) participated in an interview. Majority (81.2%) medicine purchaser, (90.9%) interview participants, and (59.4%) drug users were male. On average, each community pharmacy sold 7.9 medicines without prescription each day, to an average of 5.5 customers. Many participants (28.9%) had matriculation in their formal education. The medicines most often sold for self-medication were analgesics and antipyretics(39.4%). More than 25% of participants reported fever symptoms and 47.8% assumed their illness was too trivial to consult a doctor. Media advertisements were the most common source of information for participants (46.7%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many types of medicines were often sold without prescription from community pharmacies. Self-medication was common practice for a wide range of illnesses. Pakistan also needs effective implementation of policies to monitor medication sales.

It is controversial whether TPC2 mediates lysosomal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release or selectively conducts Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and whether the binding of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is required for the activity of this ion channel. We show that TPC2 is required for intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in response to NAADP or to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. In pulmonary arterial myocytes, rapamycin and NAADP evoked global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients that were blocked by depletion of lysosomal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores. Preincubation of cells with high concentrations of rapamycin resulted in desensitization and blocked NAADP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Moreover, rapamycin and NAADP did not evoke discernable Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in myocytes derived from &lt;i&gt;Tpcn2&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice, which showed normal responses to other Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-mobilizing signals.

M.</name></author><crawled>1523385688759</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;Two-pore segment channel 2 (TPC2) is a ubiquitously expressed, lysosomally targeted ion channel that aids in terminating autophagy and is inhibited upon its association with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). It is controversial whether TPC2 mediates lysosomal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release or selectively conducts Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and whether the binding of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is required for the activity of this ion channel. We show that TPC2 is required for intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in response to NAADP or to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. In pulmonary arterial myocytes, rapamycin and NAADP evoked global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients that were blocked by depletion of lysosomal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores. Preincubation of cells with high concentrations of rapamycin resulted in desensitization and blocked NAADP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Moreover, rapamycin and NAADP did not evoke discernable Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in myocytes derived from &lt;i&gt;Tpcn2&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice, which showed normal responses to other Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-mobilizing signals. In HEK293 cells stably overexpressing human TPC2, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mTOR blocked rapamycin- and NAADP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals.

In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa. Andexanet rapidly and dose-dependently reversed the effects of edoxaban on FXa activity and coagulation pharmacodynamic parameters &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In edoxaban-anticoagulated rabbits, andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity by 82% (from 548±87 to 100±41 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), mean unbound edoxaban plasma concentration by ~80% (from 100±10 to 21±6 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), and blood loss by 80% vs. vehicle (adjusted for control, 2.6 vs. 12.9 g; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003).

While notable success has been reached in the field of tissue clarification and confocal imaging to obtain high-fidelity maps of three-dimensional neuron organization, neuron segmentation is still far away of ground-truth and manual segmentation performed by experts may be needed. The need of an expert is in part related to the limited success of the algorithms and tools performing single-neuron segmentation from 3D microscopic image data available in the State of Art, in part to the non-complete information given by these methods, which typically perform neuron tracing and thus limit the interpretability of results. Results: In this paper, a novel algorithm for segmenting single neurons in their own arrangement within the brain is presented. The algorithm performs a region growing procedure with local thresholds based on the pixel intensity statistics typical of confocal acquisitions of biological samples and described by a mixture model. The algorithm is developed and tested on 3D confocal datasets obtained from clarified tissues. We compare the result of our algorithm with those obtained by manual segmentation performed by 6 different experts in terms of neuron surface area, volume and Sholl profiles.

While notable success has been reached in the field of tissue clarification and confocal imaging to obtain high-fidelity maps of three-dimensional neuron organization, neuron segmentation is still far away of ground-truth and manual segmentation performed by experts may be needed.

Background &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine is an α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptor agonist that causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, and so may effectively enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, there is little evidence that phenylephrine augments HPV in clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes. The P-N group had the drug-infusion in the reverse order. The primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Secondary outcomes were mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure variation, perfusion index, and difference between bladder and skin temperature. Statistical analysis was performed using the student t-test, Fisher&apos;s exact test, and ANOVA for Cross-over design. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine patients were analyzed. Although phenylephrine infusion significantly increased mean arterial pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), arterial partial pressure of oxygen did not differ between the two timepoints (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.19). There was no carryover effect in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14). Phenylephrine infusion significantly decreased heart rate (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) and pulse pressure variation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine infusion did not improve oxygenation during OLV.

Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance.

Increasing evidence indicates that the Golgi apparatus plays active roles in cancer, but a comprehensive understanding of its functions in the oncogenic transformation has not yet emerged. At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipid biosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, we analyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. We disrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as in increased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin D or Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy.</content></content><author><name>Charlotte Luchsinger</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charlotte Luchsinger, Marcelo Aguilar, Patricia V.

&lt;i&gt;Melilotus&lt;/i&gt; is an important genus of legume plants and an herbage with excellent nitrogen fixation; it can tolerate extreme environmental conditions and possesses important medicinal value. However, there is limited genetic information about the genus; thus, we analysed four chloroplast loci (&lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L, &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K, &lt;i&gt;psb&lt;/i&gt;A-&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;H and &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L-F) and one nuclear region (ITS) to determine the genetic diversity of 199 accessions from 18 &lt;i&gt;Melilotus&lt;/i&gt; species. The &lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L and &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K sequences were highly conserved, whereas the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L-F and ITS sequences contained variable and parsimony-informative sites. In our analyses of the single and combined regions, we calculated the pairwise distance, haplotype and nucleotide diversity and gaps and then constructed phylogenetic trees to assess the genetic diversity, and our results revealed significant variations among the different accessions. The genetic distance values were between zero and nine, and based on the combined regions, the highest frequency value was approximately four. &lt;i&gt;Melilotus&lt;/i&gt; showed high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, particularly in the ITS sequences, with values of 0.86 and 0.0087, respectively. The single ITS sequence, &lt;i&gt;psb&lt;/i&gt;A-&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;H, and the combined &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K+&lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L+&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L-F (MRT) and &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K+&lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L+&lt;i&gt;psb&lt;/i&gt;A-&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;H+&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L-F+ITS (MRPTI) regions showed interspecific variation in the gap analysis. Phylogenetic trees calculated using ITS, &lt;i&gt;psb&lt;/i&gt;A-&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;H and MRPTI sequences indicated distinct genetic relationship in 18 species, and these species could be divided into two groups.

It is generally believed that the unencapsulated sensory nerve terminals of modality specific C- and Aδ-neurons lack structural specialization. Here we determined the morphology of functionally defined polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors in the guinea pig corneal epithelium. Polymodal receptors and cold thermoreceptors were identified by extracellular recording at the surface of the corneal epithelium. After marking the recording sites, corneas were processed to reveal immunoreactivity for the transient receptor potential channels TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) or TPRM8 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8). Polymodal receptor nerve terminals (n = 6) were TRPV1-immunoreactive and derived from an axon that ascended from the sub-basal plexus to the squamous cell layer where it branched into fibers that ran parallel to the corneal surface and terminated with small bulbar endings (ramifying endings). Cold thermoreceptor nerve terminals were TRPM8-immunoreactive (n = 6) and originated from an axon that branched as it ascended through the wing cell and squamous cell layers and terminated with large bulbar endings (complex endings). These findings indicate that modality specific corneal sensory neurons with unencapsulated nerve endings have distinct nerve terminal morphologies that are likely to relate to their function.</content></content><author><name>Abdulhakeem S.

After marking the recording sites, corneas were processed to reveal immunoreactivity for the transient receptor potential channels TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) or TPRM8 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8). Polymodal receptor nerve terminals (n = 6) were TRPV1-immunoreactive and derived from an axon that ascended from the sub-basal plexus to the squamous cell layer where it branched into fibers that ran parallel to the corneal surface and terminated with small bulbar endings (ramifying endings). Cold thermoreceptor nerve terminals were TRPM8-immunoreactive (n = 6) and originated from an axon that branched as it ascended through the wing cell and squamous cell layers and terminated with large bulbar endings (complex endings). These findings indicate that modality specific corneal sensory neurons with unencapsulated nerve endings have distinct nerve terminal morphologies that are likely to relate to their function.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02973-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>6</engagement><title>Predicting the spatiotemporal diversity of seizure propagation and termination in human focal epilepsy</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02973-y</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16224096685:1d17c1:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02973-y</originId><published>1521010800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1fa710e3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/X8Al29uL5H8/s41467-018-02973-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Predicting the spatiotemporal diversity of seizure propagation and termination in human focal epilepsy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predicting the spatiotemporal diversity of seizure propagation and termination in human focal epilepsy, Published online: 14 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02973-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-02973-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A major goal of epilepsy research is understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of seizure.

Commercial hunting for the international trade in animal hides in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century decimated many populations of aquatic wildlife in Amazonia. However, impacts varied significantly between different species and regions, depending upon hunting intensity, accessibility of habitat, and the inherent resilience of various species and their habitats. We investigated the differential responses of two Amazonian Mustelid species, the neotropical otter and giant otter, to commercial hunting pressure along the upper Rio Negro in Brazil, and examined historical factors that influenced spatial and temporal variation in commercial exploitation. We analyzed previously unanalyzed data from historical records of hide shipments to track changes in hide sales and prices for the two species in the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. We also gathered oral histories from older Baniwa people who had witnessed or participated in commercial otter hunting. These complimentary data sources reveal how intrinsic biological and social characteristics of the two otter species interacted with market forces and regional history. Whereas giant otter populations were driven to local or regional extinction during the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century by commercial hunting, neotropical otters persisted. In recent decades, giant otter populations have returned to some parts of the upper Rio Negro, a development which local people welcome as part of a generalized recovery of the ecosystems in their territory as a result of the banning of animal pelt exports and indigenous land demarcation. This paper expands the scope of the field historical ecology and reflects on the role of local knowledge in biodiversity conservation.</content></content><author><name>Natalia C.

Antimicrobials are used in animal agriculture to cure bacterial infectious diseases. However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production.</content></content><author><name>Guillaume Lhermie</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Lhermie, Loren William Tauer, Yrjo Tapio Gröhn&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to characterize the urine metabolome of women with &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT) uro-genital infection (n = 21), comparing it with a group of CT-negative subjects (n = 98). By means of a proton-based nuclear magnetic resonance (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR) spectroscopy, we detected and quantified the urine metabolites of a cohort of 119 pre-menopausal Caucasian women, attending a STI Outpatients Clinic in Italy. In case of a CT positive result, CT molecular genotyping was performed by &lt;i&gt;omp1&lt;/i&gt; gene semi-nested PCR followed by RFLP analysis. We were able to identify several metabolites whose concentrations were significantly higher in the urine samples of CT-positive subjects, including sucrose, mannitol, pyruvate and lactate. In contrast, higher urinary levels of acetone represented the main feature of CT-negative women.
These results were not influenced by the age of patients nor by the CT serovars (D, E, F, G, K) responsible of the urethral infections. Since the presence of sugars can increase the stability of chlamydial proteins, higher levels of sucrose and mannitol in the urethral lumen, related to a higher sugar consumption, could have favoured CT infection acquisition or could have been of aid for the bacterial viability. Peculiar dietary habits of the subjects enrolled, in term of type and amount of food consumed, could probably explain these findings. Lactate and pyruvate could result from CT-induced immunopathology, as a product of the inflammatory microenvironment. Further studies are needed to understand the potential role of these metabolites in the pathogenesis of CT infection, as well as their diagnostic/prognostic use.</content></content><author><name>Claudio Foschi</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudio Foschi, Luca Laghi, Antonietta D’Antuono, Valeria Gaspari, Chenglin Zhu, Nicolò Dellarosa, Melissa Salvo, Antonella Marangoni&lt;/p&gt;

Further studies are needed to understand the potential role of these metabolites in the pathogenesis of CT infection, as well as their diagnostic/prognostic use.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Dense colloidal mixtures in an external sinusoidal potential</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5013007?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1625704c351:4c87b7f:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5013007?af=R</originId><published>1521438056000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>39eaef89</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5013007?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>R.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Paraquat poisoning can result in dysfunction of multiple organs, and pulmonary fibrosis with respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality.

The objective of this study was to determine if intubation is a NBT for patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study included 68 patients with respiratory failure due to paraquat poisoning. Patients were hospitalized at MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taitung Branch, Taiwan, between 2005 to April 2016. Composite outcomes of intra-hospital mortality, the rate of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, prescribed medications, length of stay, and medical costs were recorded and compared between the do-not-intubate (DNI) group and endotracheal intubation (EI) group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Intra-hospital mortality rate for the entire population was 100%.

Bacteriophage TP-84 is a well-characterized bacteriophage of historical interest. It is a member of the &lt;i&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/i&gt;, and infects a number of thermophilic &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;stearothermophilus&lt;/i&gt; strains. Its’ 47.7-kbp double-stranded DNA genome revealed the presence of 81 coding sequences (CDSs) coding for polypeptides of 4 kDa or larger. Interestingly, all CDSs are oriented in the same direction, pointing to a dominant transcription direction of one DNA strand. Based on a homology search, a hypothetical function could be assigned to 31 CDSs. No RNA or DNA polymerase-coding genes were found on the bacteriophage genome indicating that TP-84 relies on the host’s transcriptional and replication enzymes. The TP84 genome is tightly packed with CDSs, typically spaced by several-to-tens of bp or often overlapping.

Bacteriophage TP-84 is a well-characterized bacteriophage of historical interest. It is a member of the &lt;i&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/i&gt;, and infects a number of thermophilic &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;stearothermophilus&lt;/i&gt; strains. Its’ 47.7-kbp double-stranded DNA genome revealed the presence of 81 coding sequences (CDSs) coding for polypeptides of 4 kDa or larger. Interestingly, all CDSs are oriented in the same direction, pointing to a dominant transcription direction of one DNA strand. Based on a homology search, a hypothetical function could be assigned to 31 CDSs. No RNA or DNA polymerase-coding genes were found on the bacteriophage genome indicating that TP-84 relies on the host’s transcriptional and replication enzymes. The TP84 genome is tightly packed with CDSs, typically spaced by several-to-tens of bp or often overlapping. The genome contains five putative promoter-like sequences showing similarity to the host promoter consensus sequence and allowing for a 2-bp mismatch. In addition, ten putative rho-independent terminators were detected. Because the genome sequence shows essentially no similarity to any previously characterised bacteriophage, TP-84 should be considered a new species in an undefined genus within the &lt;i&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/i&gt; family. Thus a taxonomic proposal of a new &lt;i&gt;Tp84virus&lt;/i&gt; genus has been accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The bioinformatics genome analysis was verified by confirmation of 33 TP-84 proteins, which included: a) cloning of a selected CDS in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, coding for a DNA single-stranded binding protein (SSB; gene TP84_63), b) purification and functional assays of the recombinant TP-84 SSB, which has been shown to improve PCR reactions, c) mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of TP-84 bacteriophage capsid proteins, d) purification of TP-84 endolysin activity, e) MS analysis of the host cells from infection time course.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT) - simultaneous clade and personal genome annotation [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231118v3?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16277e48cc3:7a29f81:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/231118</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231118v3?rss=1</originId><published>1522393200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2f6c1c70</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231118v3?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The recent introductions of low-cost, long-read, and read-cloud sequencing technologies coupled with intense efforts to develop efficient algorithms have made affordable, high-quality de novo sequence assembly a realistic proposition.

Although anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is considered a successful procedure in restoring knee stability, few studies have addressed the issue of aerobic capacity after ACL surgery. Soccer players need technical, tactical and physical skills to succeed, such as good knee function and aerobic capacity. Our purpose is to evaluate aerobic fitness in ACL injured professional football players and six months after ACL reconstruction compared to a control group. Twenty athletes with ACL injury were evaluated and underwent ACL reconstruction with hamstrings autograft, and were compared to twenty healthy professional soccer players. The methods used to evaluate aerobic fitness were maximum oxygen uptake (VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt;) and ventilatory thresholds with a treadmill protocol, before and six months after surgery, compared to a control group. Knee function questionnaires, isokinetic strength testing and body composition evaluation were also performed. Results: Median ACL-injured patients age was 21 years old, and controls 20.5 years old. (n.s.). Preoperative VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt; in the ACL injured group was 45.2 ± 4.3 mL/kg/min, postoperative 48.9 ± 3.8 mL/kg/min and controls 56.9 ± 4.2 mL/kg/min. (p&amp;lt; .001 in all comparisons). Body composition evaluation was similar in all situations. Knee function questionnaires and quadriceps peak torque deficit improved after surgery but were significantly lower compared to controls. Conclusion: Aerobic fitness is significantly reduced in professional soccer players with ACL injury, and six months of rehabilitation was not enough to restore aerobic function after ACL reconstruction, compared to non-injured players of the same level.</content></content><author><name>Adriano Marques de Almeida</name></author><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adriano Marques de Almeida, Paulo Roberto Santos Silva, André Pedrinelli, Arnaldo J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Swimming in fecally-contaminated waterbodies can result in gastrointestinal infections. However, the pathogenic microorganisms responsible are not well understood because sporadic cases of illness are not reported completely, exposure information is often not collected, and epidemiology studies rely on self-reported symptoms. Noroviruses are considered a likely cause because they are found in high densities in sewage, resistant to wastewater treatment and survive in the environment. In this study, saliva samples were collected from subjects at a beach in Puerto Rico and tested for evidence of norovirus-specific IgG responses as an indicator of incident norovirus infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Saliva samples were collected from 1298 participants using an oral swab. Samples were collected on the day of the beach visit (S1); after 10–12 days (S2); and after three weeks (S3). Saliva was tested for IgG responses to GI.1 and GII.4 noroviruses using a microsphere based multiplex salivary immunoassay. Immunoconversion was defined as a four-fold increase in median fluorescence intensity (MFI) from S1 to S2 with the S3 sample at least three times above the S1 MFI.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty-four subjects (2.6%) immunoconverted to GI.1 or GII.4 norovirus. Swimmers who immersed their head in water had a higher rate of immunoconversion (3.4%), compared to either non-swimmers (0.0%, p = 0.003) or waders and non-swimmers combined (0.4%, Odds Ratio: 5.07, 95% Confidence Interval:1.48–17.00). Immunoconversion was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study to demonstrate an association between swimming at a beach impacted by fecal contamination and asymptomatic norovirus infection.

Sunscreen users are often inadequately protected and become sunburned. This study aimed to investigate how much two consecutive sunscreen applications increased the quantity of sunscreen applied and decreased the skin area left without sunscreen (missed area) compared to a single application. Thirty-one healthy volunteers wearing swimwear were included and applied sunscreen two consecutive times in a laboratory environment. Participants had pictures taken in black light before and after each application. As sunscreens absorb black light, the darkness of the skin increased with increasing amounts of sunscreen applied. We conducted a standard curve establishing a link between change in picture darkness and quantity of sunscreen. The quantity of sunscreen at selected skin sites as well as the percentage of missed area was determined after each application. Participants had missed a median of 20% of their available body surface after a single application. After double application they had missed 9%. The decrease in missed areas was significant for the whole body surface and for each of the body regions separately. The median participant had applied between 13% and 100% more sunscreen at the selected skin sites after double application than after single application. We recommend double application, especially before intense sun exposure.</content></content><author><name>Ida M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ≥15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults.

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ≥15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults.

Mosquitoes that have been genetically engineered for resistance to human pathogens are a potential new tool for controlling vector-borne disease.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming increasingly integrated into oncological practice and clinical research. NGS methods have also provided evidence for clonal evolution of cancers during disease progression and treatment. The number of variants associated with response to specific therapeutic agents keeps increasing. However, the identification of novel driver mutations as opposed to passenger (phenotypically silent or clinically irrelevant) mutations remains a major challenge. We conducted targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors from 44 pre-treated patients with solid tumors including breast, colorectal and lung carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas and others. We catalogued established driver mutations and putative new drivers as predicted by two distinct algorithms. The established drivers we detected were consistent with published observations. However, we also detected a significant number of mutations with driver potential never described before in each tumor type we studied. These putative drivers belong to key cell fate regulatory networks, including potentially druggable pathways. Should our observations be confirmed, they would support the hypothesis that new driver mutations are selected by treatment in clinically aggressive tumors, and indicate a need for longitudinal genomic testing of solid tumors to inform second line cancer treatment.</content></content><author><name>Antonio Pannuti</name></author><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Pannuti, Aleksandra Filipovic, Chindo Hicks, Elliot Lefkowitz, Travis Ptacek, Justin Stebbing, Lucio Miele&lt;/p&gt;

Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator of ecosystem functioning but how ecosystem WUE responds to climate change including precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition increases is still unknown. To investigate such responses, an experiment with a randomized block design with water (spring snowfall or summer water addition) and nitrogen addition was conducted in a temperate steppe of northern China. We investigated net ecosystem CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (NEP), gross ecosystem production (GEP) and evapotranspiration (ET) to calculate ecosystem WUE (WUEnep = NEP/ET or WUEgep = GEP/ET) under spring snow and summer water addition with or without N addition from 2011 to 2013. The results showed that spring snow addition only had significant effect on ecosystem WUE in 2013 and summer water addition showed positive effect on ecosystem WUE in 2011 and 2013, as their effects on NEP and GEP is stronger than ET. N addition increased ecosystem WUE in 2012 and 2013 both in spring snow addition and summer water addition for its increasing effects on NEP and GEP but no effect on ET. Summer water addition had less but N addition had greater increasing effects on ecosystem WUE as natural precipitation increase indicating that natural precipitation regulates ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition. Moreover, WUE was tightly related with atmospheric vapor-pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), precipitation and soil moisture indicating the regulation of climate drivers on ecosystem WUE. In addition, it also was affected by aboveground net primary production (ANPP). The study suggests that ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition is determined by the change in carbon process rather than that in water process, which are regulated by climate change in the temperate steppe of northern China.</content></content><author><name>Xiaolin Zhang</name></author><crawled>1520877426683</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaolin Zhang, Penghui Zhai, Jianhui Huang, Xiang Zhao, Kuanhu Dong&lt;/p&gt;

As persons with stroke are surviving longer, monitoring and managing their quality of life is becoming important. We reviewed the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) in order to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in stroke survivors as measured by the Euro Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D), and to find out influencing factors. A total of 42,500 subjects were enrolled in the KNHANES, and 575 of them were persons with stroke. The EQ-5D index was lower in persons with stroke than those without stroke, when adjusted for age and sex (with stroke: 0.757±0.012, without stroke: 0.948±0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .0001). Dimension-specific influencing factors of HRQoL were observed in persons with stroke; mobility problems increased with old age; self-care problems increased with old age and depression; usual activity problems increased with old age, low income, absence of economic activity, and depression; pain/discomfort problems increased with low income. The EQ-5D index was lower in stroke survivors with older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lack of regular exercise. This is the first study to utilize nationally representative data of the Korean population to investigate the effect of stroke on HRQoL and explore the dimension-specific influencing factors. Further development of rehabilitative interventions for post-stroke depression, vocational rehabilitation, and tailored programs for encouraging physical activity may be needed to improve the HRQoL in Korean stroke survivors.</content></content><author><name>SuYeon Kwon</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by SuYeon Kwon, Ji-Hong Park, Won-Seok Kim, Kyungdo Han, Yookyung Lee, Nam-Jong Paik&lt;/p&gt;

Further development of rehabilitative interventions for post-stroke depression, vocational rehabilitation, and tailored programs for encouraging physical activity may be needed to improve the HRQoL in Korean stroke survivors.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23800-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23800-w</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162710fdea9:7193cb0:9f3b30f2</id><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23800-w</originId><published>1522306800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3d152804</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/246_EITDLCs/s41598-018-23800-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways, Published online: 29 March 2018;

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a prevalent method for gene expression analysis, depending on the stability of the reference genes for data normalization. &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;speciosa&lt;/i&gt; are popular ornamental plants which are famous for the long flowering period. However, no systematic studies on reference genes in &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia&lt;/i&gt; have yet been conducted. In the present study, we selected nine candidate reference genes (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TUA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TUB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;18S&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPII&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATC&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EIF5A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) and evaluated their expression stability in different tissues during floral development of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;speciosa&lt;/i&gt; using four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and, RefFinder). Results showed that &lt;i&gt;RPII&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt; were the most stably expressed and suitable reference genes for both of &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia&lt;/i&gt; species.

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Wolfgang Giese</name></author><crawled>1523296582770</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schröder, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09965</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Catalytic Effect of Aqueous Solution in Water-Assisted Proton-Transfer Mechanism of 8-Hydroxy Guanine Radical</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09965</link><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1624476bb56:1aeaf6:a077e55f</id><recrawled>1521577030965</recrawled><unread>False</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09965</originId><crawled>1521567054678</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b09965/20180320/images/medium/jp-2017-09965s_0007.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>320</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><fingerprint>5f7778db</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b09965/20180320/images/medium/jp-2017-09965s_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09965&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</content></content><author><name>Huai Guan</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Segmentation of heterogeneous patient populations into parsimonious and relatively homogenous groups with similar healthcare needs can facilitate healthcare resource planning and development of effective integrated healthcare interventions for each segment. We aimed to apply a data-driven, healthcare utilization-based clustering analysis to segment a regional health system patient population and validate its discriminative ability on 4-year longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality data.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted data from the Singapore Health Services Electronic Health Intelligence System, an electronic medical record database that included healthcare utilization (inpatient admissions, specialist outpatient clinic visits, emergency department visits, and primary care clinic visits), mortality, diseases, and demographics for all adult Singapore residents who resided in and had a healthcare encounter with our regional health system in 2012. Hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward’s linkage) and K-means cluster analysis using age and healthcare utilization data in 2012 were applied to segment the selected population. These segments were compared using their demographics (other than age) and morbidities in 2012, and longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 146,999 subjects, five distinct patient segments “Young, healthy”; “Middle age, healthy”; “Stable, chronic disease”; “Complicated chronic disease” and “Frequent admitters” were identified. Healthcare utilization patterns in 2012, morbidity patterns and demographics differed significantly across all segments. The “Frequent admitters” segment had the smallest number of patients (1.79% of the population) but consumed 69% of inpatient admissions, 77% of specialist outpatient visits, 54% of emergency department visits, and 23% of primary care clinic visits in 2012. 11.5% and 31.2% of this segment has end stage renal failure and malignancy respectively. The validity of cluster-analysis derived segments is supported by discriminative ability for longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016. Incident rate ratios for healthcare utilization and Cox hazards ratio for mortality increased as patient segments increased in complexity. Patients in the “Frequent admitters” segment accounted for a disproportionate healthcare utilization and 8.16 times higher mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data-driven clustering analysis on a general patient population in Singapore identified five patient segments with distinct longitudinal healthcare utilization patterns and mortality risk to provide an evidence-based segmentation of a regional health system’s healthcare needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Lian Leng Low</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Leng Low, Shi Yan, Yu Heng Kwan, Chuen Seng Tan, Julian Thumboo&lt;/p&gt;

In medicine, diagnoses based on medical test results are probabilistic by nature. Unfortunately, cognitive illusions regarding the statistical meaning of test results are well documented among patients, medical students, and even physicians. There are two effective strategies that can foster insight into what is known as Bayesian reasoning situations: (1) translating the statistical information on the prevalence of a disease and the sensitivity and the false-alarm rate of a specific test for that disease from probabilities into natural frequencies, and (2) illustrating the statistical information with tree diagrams, for instance, or with other pictorial representation. So far, such strategies have only been empirically tested in combination for “1-test cases”, where one binary hypothesis (“disease” vs. “no disease”) has to be diagnosed based on one binary test result (“positive” vs. “negative”). However, in reality, often more than one medical test is conducted to derive a diagnosis. In two studies, we examined a total of 388 medical students from the University of Regensburg (Germany) with medical “2-test scenarios”. Each student had to work on two problems: diagnosing breast cancer with mammography and sonography test results, and diagnosing HIV infection with the ELISA and Western Blot tests. In Study 1 (N = 190 participants), we systematically varied the presentation of statistical information (“only textual information” vs. “only tree diagram” vs. “text and tree diagram in combination”), whereas in Study 2 (N = 198 participants), we varied the kinds of tree diagrams (“complete tree” vs. “highlighted tree” vs. “pruned tree”). All versions were implemented in probability format (including probability trees) and in natural frequency format (including frequency trees). We found that natural frequency trees, especially when the question-related branches were highlighted, improved performance, but that none of the corresponding probabilistic visualizations did.</content></content><author><name>Karin Binder</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karin Binder, Stefan Krauss, Georg Bruckmaier, Jörg Marienhagen&lt;/p&gt;

The human gut microbiome contributes to a broad range of biochemical and metabolic functions that directly or indirectly affect human physiology. Several recent studies have indicated that factors like age, geographical location, genetic makeup, and individual health status significantly influence the diversity, stability, and resilience of the gut microbiome. Of the mentioned factors, geographical location (and related dietary/socio-economic context) appears to explain a significant portion of microbiome variation observed in various previously conducted base-line studies on human gut microbiome. Given this context, we have undertaken a microbiome study with the objective of cataloguing the taxonomic diversity of gut microbiomes sampled from an urban cohort from Ahmedabad city in Western India. Computational analysis of microbiome sequence data corresponding to 160 stool samples (collected from 80 healthy individuals at two time-points, 60 days apart) has indicated a &lt;i&gt;Prevotella&lt;/i&gt;-dominated microbial community. Given that the typical diet of participants included carbohydrate and fibre-rich components (predominantly whole grains and legume-based preparations), results appear to validate the proposed correlation between diet/geography and microbiome composition. Comparative analysis of obtained gut microbiome profiles with previously published microbiome profiles from US, China, Finland, and Japan additionally reveals a distinct taxonomic and (inferred) functional niche for the sampled microbiomes.</content></content><author><name>Disha Tandon</name></author><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Disha Tandon, Mohammed Monzoorul Haque, Saravanan R., Shafiq Shaikh, Sriram P., Ashok Kumar Dubey, Sharmila S.

Comparative analysis of obtained gut microbiome profiles with previously published microbiome profiles from US, China, Finland, and Japan additionally reveals a distinct taxonomic and (inferred) functional niche for the sampled microbiomes.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Correction: Type III CRISPR-Cas systems can provide redundancy to counteract viral escape from type I systems</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36853</link><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162912bdf7d:9b1efc8:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36853</canonicalUrl><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36853</originId><crawled>1522853994365</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Genomics and Evolutionary Biology</item></keywords><fingerprint>70a895d9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36853</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1522800000000</published></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Mechanistic basis for the activation of plant membrane receptor kinases by SERK-family coreceptors [Plant Biology]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3488.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:63522a0:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/13/3488/F4.medium.gif</url><width>369</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>440</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3488</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3488.short?rss=1</originId><published>1522168915000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>543a790d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3488.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Plant-unique membrane receptor kinases with leucine-rich repeat ectodomains (LRR-RKs) can sense small molecule, peptide, and protein ligands.

The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is becoming the method of choice for expression of many eukaryotic proteins and protein complexes for biochemical, structural and pharmaceutical studies. Significant technological advancement has made generation of recombinant baculoviruses easy, efficient and user-friendly. However, there is a tremendous variability in the amount of proteins made using the BEVS, including different batches of virus made to express the same proteins. Yet, what influences the overall production of proteins or protein complexes remains largely unclear. Many downstream applications, particularly protein structure determination, require purification of large quantities of proteins in a repetitive manner, calling for a reliable experimental set-up to obtain proteins or protein complexes of interest consistently. During our investigation of optimizing the expression of the Mediator Head module, we discovered that the ‘initial infectivity’ was an excellent indicator of overall production of protein complexes. Further, we show that this initial infectivity can be mathematically described as a function of multiplicity of infection (MOI), correlating recombinant protein yield and virus titer. All these findings led us to develop the Titer Estimation for Quality Control (TEQC) method, which enables researchers to estimate initial infectivity, titer/MOI values in a simple and affordable way, and to use these values to quantitatively optimize protein expressions utilizing BEVS in a highly reproducible fashion.</content></content><author><name>Tsuyoshi Imasaki</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsuyoshi Imasaki, Sabine Wenzel, Kentaro Yamada, Megan L.

Based on extensive Langevin Dynamics simulations we investigate the structural properties of a two-dimensional ensemble of magnetic rods with a peapod-like morphology, i.e, rods consisting of aligned single dipolar beads. Self-assembled configurations are studied for different directions of the dipole with respect to the rod axis. We found that with increasing misalignment of the dipole from the rod axis, the smaller the packing fraction at which the percolation transition is found. For the same density, the system exhibits different aggregation states for different misalignment. We also study the stability of the percolated structures with respect to temperature, which is found to be affected by the microstructure of the assembly of rods.</content></content><author><name>Jorge L.

We also study the stability of the percolated structures with respect to temperature, which is found to be affected by the microstructure of the assembly of rods.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23741-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Pigmentation pattern and developmental constraints: flight muscle attachment sites delimit the thoracic trident of Drosophila melanogaster</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23741-4</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1626be58cb9:679a5cb:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23741-4/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23741_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>314</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23741-4</originId><published>1522220400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>956f79ab</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/M6rGKPjOFsM/s41598-018-23741-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pigmentation pattern and developmental constraints: flight muscle attachment sites delimit the thoracic trident of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigmentation pattern and developmental constraints: flight muscle attachment sites delimit the thoracic trident of &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23741-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23741-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Pigmentation pattern and developmental constraints: flight muscle attachment sites delimit the thoracic trident of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/M6rGKPjOFsM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jean-Michel Gibert</name></author><crawled>1522228628665</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pigmentation pattern and developmental constraints: flight muscle attachment sites delimit the thoracic trident of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigmentation pattern and developmental constraints: flight muscle attachment sites delimit the thoracic trident of &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23741-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23741-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Pigmentation pattern and developmental constraints: flight muscle attachment sites delimit the thoracic trident of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/M6rGKPjOFsM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>The phylogenetic analysis of VP1 genomic region in foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype O isolates in Sri Lanka reveals the existence of &apos;Srl-97&apos;, a newly named endemic lineage</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194077</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c0:34f43e70</id><updated>1521838800000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194077</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194077</originId><published>1521838800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>601ed344</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194077</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by S.

Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has devastated the cattle industry in Sri Lanka many times in the past. Despite its seriousness, limited attempts have been made to understand the disease to ameliorate its effects–current recommendation for vaccines being based solely on immunological assessments rather than on molecular identification. The general belief is that the cattle population in Sri Lanka acquired the FMD virus (FMDV) strains via introductions from India. However, there could be endemic FMDV lineages circulating in Sri Lanka. To infer the phylogenetic relationships of the FMDV strains in the island, we sequenced the VP1 genomic region of the virus isolates collected during the 2014 outbreak together with a few reported cases in 2012 and 1997 and compared them to VP1 sequences from South Asia. The FMDV strains collected in the 2014 outbreak belonged to the lineage, Ind-2001d, of the topotype, ME-SA. The strains collected in 2012 and 1997 belonged to another lineage called &apos;unnamed&apos; by the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease (WRLFMD). Based on the present analysis, we designate the lineage &apos;unnamed&apos; as Srl-97 which we found endemic to Sri Lanka. The evolutionary rates of Srl-97 and Ind-2001d in Sri Lanka were estimated to be 0.0004 and 0.0046 substitutions/site/year, respectively, suggesting that Srl-97 evolves slowly.</content></content><author><name>S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Diagnosing HIV and/or TB is not sufficient; linkage to care and treatment is conditional to reduce the burden of disease. This study aimed to determine factors associated with linkage to HIV care and TB treatment at community-based services in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized routinely collected data from clients who utilized stand-alone (fixed site not attached to a health facility) and mobile HIV testing services in eight communities in the City of Cape Town Metropolitan district, between January 2008 and June 2012. Clients were included in the analysis if they were ≥12 years and had a known HIV status. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression models were used to assess the association between determinants (sex, age, HIV testing service and co-infection status) and self-reported linkage to HIV care and/or TB treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Linkage to HIV care was 3 738/5 929 (63.1%). Linkage to HIV care was associated with the type of HIV testing service. Clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services had a significantly reduced odds of linking to HIV care (aOR 0.7 (CI 95%: 0.6–0.8), p&amp;lt;0.001. Linkage to TB treatment was 210/275 (76.4%). Linkage to TB treatment was not associated with sex and service type, but was associated with age. Clients in older age groups were less likely to link to TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years (all, p-value&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A large proportion of clients diagnosed with HIV at mobile services did not link to care.

For CyberKnife-mediated prostate cancer treatment, a tumour-tracking approach is applied to correct the target location by acquiring X-ray images of implanted fiducial markers intermittently. This study investigated the dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion during CyberKnife treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients treated using the CyberKnife (35 Gy delivered in five fractions). Using log files of recorded prostate motion, the intra-fraction prostate motion was simulated. We defined the worst-case intra-fraction prostate motion as the difference between pre- and post-deviation on log files and shifted structure sets according to the corresponding offsets for each beam. The dose–volume indices were calculated and compared with the original plan in terms of clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (CTV plus a 2-mm margin), rectum, bladder, and urethra. Prostate motions of &gt;3, &gt;5, and &gt;10 mm were observed for 31.3, 9.1, and 0.5% of the 1929 timestamps, respectively. Relative differences between the simulated and original plans were mostly less than 1%. Although significant decreases were observed in D&lt;sub&gt;50%&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;98%&lt;/sub&gt; of the target, absolute dose differences were &amp;lt;0.1 Gy compared with the planned dose.

The main drawback of ranking of researchers by the number of papers, citations or by the Hirsch index is ignoring the problem of distributing authorship among authors in multi-author publications. So far, the single-author or multi-author publications contribute to the publication record of a researcher equally. This full counting scheme is apparently unfair and causes unjust disproportions, in particular, if ranked researchers have distinctly different collaboration profiles. These disproportions are removed by less common fractional or authorship-weighted counting schemes, which can distribute the authorship credit more properly and suppress a tendency to unjustified inflation of co-authors. The urgent need of widely adopting a fair ranking scheme in practise is exemplified by analysing citation profiles of several highly-cited astronomers and astrophysicists. While the full counting scheme often leads to completely incorrect and misleading ranking, the fractional or authorship-weighted schemes are more accurate and applicable to ranking of researchers as well as research teams. In addition, they suppress differences in ranking among scientific disciplines. These more appropriate schemes should urgently be adopted by scientific publication databases as the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) or the Scopus (Elsevier).</content></content><author><name>Václav Vavryčuk</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Václav Vavryčuk&lt;/p&gt;

We discuss a novel type of surface soliton—aberrated surface soliton—appearance in a nonlinear one dimensional photonic crystal and a possibility of this surface soliton formation in two dimensional photonic crystal. An aberrated surface soliton possesses a nonlinear distribution of the wavefront. We show that, in one dimensional photonic crystal, the surface soliton is formed at the photonic crystal boundary with the ambient medium. Essentially, that it occupies several layers at the photonic crystal boundary and penetrates into the ambient medium at a distance also equal to several layers, so that one can infer about light energy localization at the lateral surface of the photonic crystal. In the one dimensional case, the surface soliton is formed from an earlier formed soliton that falls along the photonic crystal layers at an angle which differs slightly from the normal to the photonic crystal face. In the two dimensional case, the soliton can appear if an incident Gaussian beam falls on the photonic crystal face. The influence of laser radiation parameters, optical properties of photonic crystal layers and ambient medium on the one dimensional surface soliton formation is investigated. We also discuss the influence of two dimensional photonic crystal configuration on light energy localization near the photonic crystal surface. It is important that aberrated surface solitons can be created at relatively low laser pulse intensity and for close values of alternating layers dielectric permittivity which allows their experimental observation.</content></content><author><name>Vyacheslav A.

Despite large efforts, datasets with few sightings are often available for rare species of marine megafauna that typically live at low densities. This paucity of data makes modelling the habitat of these taxa particularly challenging. We tested the predictive performance of different types of species distribution models fitted to decreasing numbers of sightings. Generalised additive models (GAMs) with three different residual distributions and the presence only model MaxEnt were tested on two megafauna case studies differing in both the number of sightings and ecological niches. From a dolphin (277 sightings) and an auk (1,455 sightings) datasets, we simulated rarity with a sighting thinning protocol by random sampling (without replacement) of a decreasing fraction of sightings. Better prediction of the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a narrow habitat (auk dataset) was expected compared to the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a broad habitat (dolphin dataset). We used the original datasets to set up a baseline model and fitted additional models on fewer sightings but keeping effort constant. Model predictive performance was assessed with mean squared error and area under the curve. Predictions provided by the models fitted to the thinned-out datasets were better than a homogeneous spatial distribution down to a threshold of approximately 30 sightings for a GAM with a Tweedie distribution and approximately 130 sightings for the other models. Thinning the sighting data for the taxon with narrower habitats seemed to be less detrimental to model predictive performance than for the broader habitat taxon. To generate reliable habitat modelling predictions for rarely sighted marine predators, our results suggest (1) using GAMs with a Tweedie distribution with presence-absence data and (2) implementing, as a conservative empirical measure, at least 50 sightings in the models.</content></content><author><name>Auriane Virgili</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Auriane Virgili, Matthieu Authier, Pascal Monestiez, Vincent Ridoux&lt;/p&gt;

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have remarkable properties: they represent the most abundant cycling cell population in the adult normal brain and they manage to achieve a uniform and constant density throughout the adult brain. This equilibrium is obtained by the interplay of four processes: division, differentiation or death, migration and active self-repulsion. They are also strongly suspected to be at the origin of gliomas, when their equilibrium is disrupted. In this article, we present a model of the dynamics of OPCs, first in a normal tissue. This model is based on a cellular automaton and its rules are mimicking the ones that regulate the dynamics of real OPCs. The model is able to reproduce the homeostasis of the cell population, with the maintenance of a constant and uniform cell density and the healing of a lesion. We show that there exists a fair quantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental parameters, such as the cell velocity, the time taken to close a lesion, and the duration of the cell cycle. We present three possible scenarios of disruption of the equilibrium: the appearance of an over-proliferating cell, of a deadless/non-differentiating cell, or of a cell that lost any contact-inhibition. We show that the appearance of an over-proliferating cell is sufficient to trigger the growth of a tumor that has low-grade glioma features: an invasive behaviour, a linear radial growth of the tumor with a corresponding growth velocity of less than 2 mm per year, as well a cell density at the center which exceeds the one in normal tissue by a factor of less than two. The loss of contact inhibition leads to a more high-grade-like glioma. The results of our model contribute to the body of evidence that identify OPCs as possible cells of origin of gliomas.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4yhFdqGpIbo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Aloys Dufour</name></author><crawled>1522258976113</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aloys Dufour, Emilie Gontran, Christophe Deroulers, Pascale Varlet, Johan Pallud, Basile Grammaticos, Mathilde Badoual&lt;/p&gt;

A goal of genomics is to understand the relationships between biological processes. Pathways contribute to functional interplay within biological processes through complex but poorly understood interactions. However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships.

Social medical insurance schemes are crucial for realizing universal health coverage and health equity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how reimbursement for injury-induced medical expenses is addressed in Chinese legislative documents relevant to social medical insurance. We retrieved legislative documents from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Lawyee databases. Four types of social medical insurance schemes were included: urban employee basic medical insurance, urban resident basic medical insurance, new rural cooperative medical system, and urban and rural resident medical insurance. Text analyses were conducted on all identified legislative documents. As a result, one national law and 1,037 local legislative documents were identified. 1,012 of the 1,038 documents provided for reimbursement. Of the 1,012 documents, 828 (82%) provided reimbursement only for injuries without a legally responsible person/party or not caused by self-harm, alcohol use, drug use, or other law violations, and 162 (16%) did not include any details concerning implementation. Furthermore, 760 (92%) of the 828 did not provide an exception clause applying to injuries when a responsible person/party could not be contacted or for situations when the injured person cannot obtain reimbursement from the responsible person/party. Thus, most Chinese legislative documents related to social medical insurance do not provide reimbursement for medical expenses from injuries having a legally responsible person/party or those caused by illegal behaviors. We argue that all injury-induced medical expenses should be covered by legislative documents related to social medical insurance in China, no matter what the cause of the injury. Further research is needed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of such policy changes.</content></content><author><name>Yuyan Gao</name></author><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuyan Gao, Li Li, David C.

Decades of research have demonstrated the crucial importance of viruses in freshwater ecosystems. However, few studies have focused on the seasonal dynamics and potential hosts of RNA viruses. We surveyed microbial-sized (i.e. 5–0.2 μm) mixed community plankton transcriptomes for RNA viral genomes and investigated their distribution between microbial and macrobial plankton over a seasonal cycle across three temperate lakes by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). A total of 30 contigs bearing similarity to RNA viral genomes were recovered from a global assembly of 30 plankton RNA libraries. Of these, only 13 were found in &gt;2 libraries and recruited &gt;100 reads (of 9.13 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; total reads), representing several picornaviruses, two tobamoviruses and a reovirus. We quantified the abundance of four picornaviruses and the reovirus monthly from August 2014 to May 2015. Patterns of viral abundance in the &gt;5 μm size fraction and representation in microbial-sized community RNA libraries over time suggest that one picornavirus genotype (TS24835) and the reovirus (TS148892) may infect small (&amp;lt;5 μm) eukaryotic microorganisms, while two other picornaviruses (TS24641 and TS4340) may infect larger (&gt;5 μm) eukaryotic microorganisms or metazoa. Our data also suggest that picornavirus TS152062 may originate from an allochthonous host. All five viral genotypes were present in at least one size fraction across all 3 lakes during the year, suggesting that RNA viruses may easily disperse between adjacent aquatic habitats. Our data therefore demonstrate that RNA viruses are widespread in temperate lacustrine ecosystems, and may provide evidence of viral infection in larger eukaryotes (including metazoa) inhabiting the lakes.</content></content><author><name>Ian Hewson</name></author><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ian Hewson, Kalia S.

We found that NO production and tau acetylation at Lys&lt;sup&gt;280&lt;/sup&gt; occurred in the brain tissue in mice and in cultured mouse cortical neurons in response to exposure to amyloid-β&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;), a peptide that is also implicated in AD.

Virus-mediated expression of defined transcription factor (TF) genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming. However, sustained expression of the TFs often hinders pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation into specific cell types, as each TF exerts its effect on PSCs for a defined period of time during differentiation. Here, we applied a bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS)-based protein delivery tool to directly translocate TFs in the form of protein into human PSCs. This transient protein delivery technique showed high delivery efficiency for hPSCs, and it avoids potential genetic alterations caused by the introduction of transgenes. In an established cardiomyocyte &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; differentiation procedure, five transcriptional factors, namely GATA4, MEF2C, TBX5, ESRRG and MESP1 (abbreviated as GMTEM), were translocated at various time points. By detecting the expression of cardiac marker genes (&lt;i&gt;Nkx2&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cTnT&lt;/i&gt;), we found that GMTEM proteins delivered on mesoderm stage of the cardiomyocytes lineage differentiation significantly enhanced both the human ESC and iPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes, while earlier or later delivery diminished the enhancing effect. Furthermore, all of the five factors were required to enhance the cardiac differentiation. This work provides a virus-free strategy of transient transcription factors delivery for directing human stem cell fate without jeopardizing genome integrity, thus safe for biomedical applications.</content></content><author><name>Yongxin Jin</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yongxin Jin, Ying Liu, Zhenpeng Li, Katherine Santostefano, Jing Shi, Xinwen Zhang, Donghai Wu, Zhihui Cheng, Weihui Wu, Naohiro Terada, Shouguang Jin, Fang Bai&lt;/p&gt;

Aquaculture is increasing rapidly to meet global seafood demand. Some hydroid populations have been linked to mortality and health issues in finfish and shellfish, but their dynamics in and around aquaculture farms remain understudied. In the present work, two experiments, each with 36 panels, tested colonization (factors: depth, season of immersion) and succession (factors: depth, submersion duration) over one year. Hydroid surface cover was estimated for each species, and data were analyzed with multivariate techniques. The assemblage of hydrozoans was species-poor, although species richness, frequency and abundance increased with time, paralleling the overall increase in structural complexity of fouling assemblages. Submersion duration and season of immersion were particularly important in determining the species composition of the assemblages in the succession and colonization experiments, respectively. Production of water-borne propagules, including medusae, from the hydroids was observed from locally abundant colonies, among them the well-known fouling species &lt;i&gt;Obelia dichotoma&lt;/i&gt;, potentially representing a nuisance for cultured fish through contact-driven envenomations and gill disorders. The results illustrate the potential importance of fouling hydroids and their medusae to the health of organisms in the aquaculture industry.</content></content><author><name>Luis Martell</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luis Martell, Roberta Bracale, Steven A.

It is now well accepted that radiation induced bystander effects can occur in cells exposed to media from irradiated cells. The aim of this study was to follow the bystander cells in real time following addition of media from irradiated cells and to determine the effect of inhibiting these signals. A human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells, was irradiated (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy) with γ irradiation, conditioned medium was harvested after one hour and added to recipient bystander cells. Reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, Glutathione levels, caspase activation, cytotoxicity and cell viability was measured after the addition of irradiated cell conditioned media to bystander cells. Reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide levels in bystander cells treated with 0.5Gy ICCM were analysed in real time using time lapse fluorescence microscopy. The levels of reactive oxygen species were also measured in real time after the addition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathway inhibitors. ROS and glutathione levels were observed to increase after the addition of irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). Caspase activation was found to increase 4 hours after irradiated cell conditioned media treatment (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM) and this increase was observed up to 8 hours and there after a reduction in caspase activation was observed. A decrease in cell viability was observed but no major change in cytotoxicity was found in HaCaT cells after treatment with irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). This study involved the identification of key signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, glutathione and caspases generated in bystander cells. These results suggest a clear connection between reactive oxygen species and cell survival pathways with persistent production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in bystander cells following exposure to irradiated cell conditioned media.</content></content><author><name>Kishore Kumar Jella</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kishore Kumar Jella, Roisin Moriarty, Brendan McClean, Hugh J.

Caspase activation was found to increase 4 hours after irradiated cell conditioned media treatment (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM) and this increase was observed up to 8 hours and there after a reduction in caspase activation was observed. A decrease in cell viability was observed but no major change in cytotoxicity was found in HaCaT cells after treatment with irradiated cell conditioned media (0.005, 0.05 and 0.5 Gy ICCM). This study involved the identification of key signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, glutathione and caspases generated in bystander cells. These results suggest a clear connection between reactive oxygen species and cell survival pathways with persistent production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in bystander cells following exposure to irradiated cell conditioned media.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Advances of the reverse lactate threshold test: Non-invasive proposal based on heart rate and effect of previous cycling experience</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194313</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d6d:9f3b30f2</id><fingerprint>f1393110</fingerprint><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194313</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194313</originId><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><updated>1520974800000</updated><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194313</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Leonardo Henrique Dalcheco Messias, Emanuel Elias Camolese Polisel, Fúlvia Barros Manchado-Gobatto&lt;/p&gt;
Our first aim was to compare the anaerobic threshold (AnT) determined by the incremental protocol with the reverse lactate threshold test (RLT), investigating the previous cycling experience effect. Secondarily, an alternative RLT application based on heart rate was proposed. Two groups (12 per group-according to cycling experience) were evaluated on cycle ergometer. The incremental protocol started at 25 W with increments of 25 W at each 3 minutes, and the AnT was calculated by bissegmentation, onset of blood lactate concentration and maximal deviation methods. The RLT was applied in two phases: a) lactate priming segment; and b) reverse segment; the AnT (AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt;) was calculated based on a second order polynomial function. The AnT from the RLT was calculated based on the heart rate (AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt;) by the second order polynomial function. In regard of the Study 1, most of statistical procedures converged for similarity between the AnT determined from the bissegmentation method and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt;. For 83% of non-experienced and 75% of experienced subjects the bias was 4% and 2%, respectively. In Study 2, no difference was found between the AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT&lt;/sub&gt; and AnT&lt;sub&gt;RLT-HR&lt;/sub&gt;.

In summary, the AnT determined by the incremental protocol and RLT are consistent. The AnT can be determined during the RLT via heart rate, improving its applicability.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Maslinic acid (MA) is a component derived from a natural olive-based extract known to have pharmacological functions that include suppressing inflammation. This study examined how MA, in conjunction with whole-body vibration training (WBVT), can improve knee and muscle function in elderly women with knee osteoarthritis (OA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized intervention study that enrolled individuals with knee pain. Participants were 26 females aged 65–85 years with knee OA. They performed WBVT and ingested either 16.7 mg of MA or a placebo daily for 20 weeks. We compared the effect of WBVT with placebo (WBVT/P) and WBVT with MA (WBVT/MA) in participants with various degrees of knee OA (Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) grade) using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and isokinetic dynamometer measurements to evaluate knee and muscle function with two-way ANOVA.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Based on the results of two-way ANOVA analysis of muscle function measurements, there was significant interaction (time × group) (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) in the “isokinetic extension peak torque” domain for severe OA (K-L grade ≥ 3). The simple main effect of time in the WBVT/MA group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) contributed to this interaction. The JOA score for WBVT/MA supported the main effect of group as having a significant correlation in the “pain on walking” (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) and “range of motion” (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) domains. Participants with severe knee OA in the WBVT/MA group improved in these domains, whereas the WBVT/P group had few positive results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Participants with severe OA who ingested MA in conjunction with WBVT improved their knee and muscle function. This study suggests that ingesting the anti-inflammatory supplement MA while participating in WBVT, elderly women can reduce knee OA and improve their knee muscle strength.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jieun Yoon</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jieun Yoon, Akihiro Kanamori, Keisuke Fujii, Hiroko Isoda, Tomohiro Okura&lt;/p&gt;

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Ivan Dotu</name></author><crawled>1522346868231</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Dotu, Scott I.

Background &lt;p&gt;Heavy burden of child injuries and lack of policy response in Ethiopia call for an improved understanding of the situation and development of action plans from multiple governmental agencies and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A consortium of international and Ethiopian researchers and stakeholders used extensive literature review and mixed analytical methods to estimate and project the burden of fatal and non-fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2030. Estimates were derived for children aged 0–14 years.

The leading cause of fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia was road-traffic injuries, followed by fire, heat and hot substances and drowning. The death rate due to injuries among 0–14 years olds was about 50 percent higher in males than females. Rural children were exposed to a greater risk of injury than their urban peers. The longitudinal survey suggests that the incidence rate of child injuries increased during the period 2011–2014. The annual mortality caused by injuries is projected to increase from 10,697 in 2015 to 11,279 in 2020 and 11,989 in 2030 among children under 5 years, an increase of 12 percentage points in 15 years. The number of deaths among 0-14-year olds will be 26,463, 27,807, and 30,364 respectively in 2015, 2020, and 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;As the first multisectoral collaboration on child injuries in Ethiopia, this study identified gaps in understanding of the burden of child injuries in Ethiopia.

Background &lt;p&gt;Heavy burden of child injuries and lack of policy response in Ethiopia call for an improved understanding of the situation and development of action plans from multiple governmental agencies and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A consortium of international and Ethiopian researchers and stakeholders used extensive literature review and mixed analytical methods to estimate and project the burden of fatal and non-fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2030. Estimates were derived for children aged 0–14 years.

Muscle atrophy (loss of skeletal muscle mass) causes progressive deterioration of skeletal function. Recently, excessive intake of fats was suggested to induce insulin resistance, followed by muscle atrophy. Green tea extracts (GTEs), which contain polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate, have beneficial effects on obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, but their effects against muscle atrophy are still unclear. Here, we found that GTEs prevented high-fat (HF) diet–induced muscle weight loss in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8), a murine model of senescence. SAMP8 mice were fed a control diet, an HF diet, or HF with 0.5% GTEs (HFGT) diet for 4 months. The HF diet induced muscle weight loss with aging (measured as quadriceps muscle weight), whereas GTEs prevented this loss. In HF diet–fed mice, blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations increased in comparison with the control group, and these mice had insulin resistance as determined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In these mice, serum concentrations of leukocyte cell–derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), which is known to induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, were elevated, and insulin signaling in muscle, as determined by the phosphorylation levels of Akt and p70 S6 kinases, tended to be decreased. In HFGT diet–fed mice, these signs of insulin resistance and elevation of serum LECT2 were not observed. Although our study did not directly show the effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, insulin resistance examined using HOMA-IR indicated an intervention effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, as revealed by partial correlation analysis. Accordingly, GTEs might have beneficial effects on age-related and HF diet–induced muscle weight loss, which correlates with insulin resistance and is accompanied by a change in serum LECT2.</content></content><author><name>Shintaro Onishi</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shintaro Onishi, Mayu Ishino, Hidefumi Kitazawa, Ai Yoto, Yuki Shimba, Yusuke Mochizuki, Keiko Unno, Shinichi Meguro, Ichiro Tokimitsu, Shinji Miura&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Trauma is a global burden of disease and one of the main causes of death worldwide. Therefore, many countries around the world have implemented a wide range of different initiatives to minimize mortality rates after trauma. One of these initiatives is the bundling of treatment expertise in trauma centers and the establishment of trauma networks.Germany has a decentralized system of trauma care medical centers. Severely injured patients ought to receive adequate treatment in both level I and level II centers. This study investigated the effectiveness of a decentralized network and the question whether level I and level II centers have comparable patient outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;In 2009, the first trauma network DGU&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; in Germany was certified in the rural area of Eastern Bavaria. All patients admitted to the 25 participating hospitals were prospectively included in this network in the framework of a study sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research between March 2012 and February 2014. 2 hospitals were level I centers (maximal care centers), 8 hospitals were level II centers, and 15 hospitals were level III centers. The criterion for study inclusion was an injury severity score (ISS) ≥ 16 for patients´ primarily admitted to a level I or a level II center. Exclusion criteria were transferal to another hospital within 48 h, an unknown revised injury severity classification II score (RISC II), or primary admittance to a level III center (n = 52). 875 patients were included in the study.Univariate analyses were used regarding the preclinical and clinical parameters, the primary endpoint mortality rate, and the secondary endpoints length of stay, organ failure, and neurological outcome (GOS). The primary endpoint was additionally evaluated by means of multivariable analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Indices for injury severity (GCS, AIS&lt;sub&gt;Head&lt;/sub&gt;, ISS, and NISS) as well as the predicted probability of death (RISC II) were higher in level I centers than in level II centers.No significant differences were found between the mortality rate of the unadjusted analysis [level I: 21.6% (CI: 16.5, 27.9), level II: 18.1% (CI: 14.4, 22.5), p = 0.28] and that of the adjusted analysis [level I SMR: 0.94 (CI: 0.72, 1.21), level II SMR: 1.18 (CI 0.95, 1.48) SMR: expected vs. calculated mortality rate according to RISC II]. Multivariable analysis showed a survival advantage of patients admitted to a level I center with a probability of death of 13% (RISC II). The number need to treat was 10 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that a rural trauma network with centralized and local structures may achieve equivalent results with regard to mortality rates to those obtained in level I and level II centers. These results were furthered by a certain preclinical centralization (24/7 air rescue) of patients. The study also showed a survival advantage of patients admitted to a level I center with a probability of death of 13%.

Preclinical and initial clinical evaluation with regard to probable mortality rates should be further improved to identify patients who would benefit from admittance to a level I center.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006052</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Epigenetic regulation of cell fate reprogramming in aging and disease: A predictive computational model</title><recrawled>1521145272972</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006052</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1622ace2bc4:b9c550:bdf8aaf1</id><updated>1521147600000</updated><unread>False</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006052</originId><published>1521147600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f2ca599a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/O1S3sVW-8ko/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Núria Folguera-Blasco, Elisabet Cuyàs, Javier A.

Understanding the control of epigenetic regulation is key to explain and modify the aging process. Because histone-modifying enzymes are sensitive to shifts in availability of cofactors (e.g. metabolites), cellular epigenetic states may be tied to changing conditions associated with cofactor variability. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationships between cofactor fluctuations, epigenetic landscapes, and cell state transitions. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we generate an ensemble of epigenetic regulation (ER) systems whose heterogeneity reflects variability in cofactor pools used by histone modifiers. The heterogeneity of epigenetic metabolites, which operates as regulator of the kinetic parameters promoting/preventing histone modifications, stochastically drives phenotypic variability. The ensemble of ER configurations reveals the occurrence of distinct epi-states within the ensemble. Whereas resilient states maintain large epigenetic barriers refractory to reprogramming cellular identity, plastic states lower these barriers, and increase the sensitivity to reprogramming. Moreover, fine-tuning of cofactor levels redirects plastic epigenetic states to re-enter epigenetic resilience, and vice versa. Our ensemble model agrees with a model of metabolism-responsive loss of epigenetic resilience as a cellular aging mechanism. Our findings support the notion that cellular aging, and its reversal, might result from stochastic translation of metabolic inputs into resilient/plastic cell states via ER systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O1S3sVW-8ko&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Núria Folguera-Blasco</name></author><crawled>1521136577476</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Núria Folguera-Blasco, Elisabet Cuyàs, Javier A.

A heterozygous mutation in the Wolfram syndrome type 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;WFS1&lt;/i&gt;) causes autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hereditary hearing loss, DFNA6/14/38, or Wolfram-like syndrome. To date, more than 40 different mutations have been reported to be responsible for DFNA6/14/38. In the present study, &lt;i&gt;WFS1&lt;/i&gt; variants were screened in a large series of Japanese hearing loss (HL) patients to clarify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DFNA6/14/38 and Wolfram-like syndrome. Massively parallel DNA sequencing of 68 target genes was performed in 2,549 unrelated Japanese HL patients to identify genomic variations responsible for HL. The detailed clinical features in patients with &lt;i&gt;WFS1&lt;/i&gt; variants were collected from medical charts and analyzed. We successfully identified 13 &lt;i&gt;WFS1&lt;/i&gt; variants in 19 probands: eight of the 13 variants were previously reported mutations, including three mutations (p.A684V, p.K836N, and p.E864K) known to cause Wolfram-like syndrome, and five were novel mutations. Variants were detected in 15 probands (2.5%) in 602 families with presumably autosomal dominant or mitochondrial HL, and in four probands (0.7%) in 559 sporadic cases; however, no variants were detected in the other 1,388 probands with autosomal recessive or unknown family history. Among the 30 individuals possessing variants, marked variations were observed in the onset of HL as well as in the presence of progressive HL and tinnitus. Vestibular symptoms, which had been rarely reported, were present in 7 out of 30 (23%) of the affected individuals. The most prevalent audiometric configuration was low-frequency type; however, some individuals had high-frequency HL. Haplotype analysis in three mutations (p.A716T, p.K836T, and p.E864K) suggested that the mutations occurred at these mutation hot spots.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Respectful and dignified healthcare is a fundamental right for every woman. However, many women seeking childbirth services, especially those in low-income countries such as Pakistan, are mistreated by their birth attendants. The aim of this epidemiological study was to estimate the prevalence of mistreatment and types of mistreatment among women giving birth in facility- and home-based settings in Pakistan in order to address the lack of empirical evidence on this topic. The study also examined the association between demographics (socio-demographic, reproductive history and empowerment status) and mistreatment, both in general and according to birth setting (whether home- or facility-based).&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;In phase one, we identified 24 mistreatment indicators through an extensive literature review. We then pre-tested these indicators and classified them into seven behavioural types. During phase two, the survey was conducted (April-May 2013) in 14 districts across Pakistan. A total of 1,334 women who had given birth at home or in a healthcare facility over the past 12 months were interviewed. Linear regression analysis was employed for the full data set, and for facility- and home-based births separately, using Stata version 14.1.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in manifestations of mistreatment between facility- and home-based childbirths. Approximately 97% of women reported experiencing at least one disrespectful and abusive behaviour. Experiences of mistreatment by type were as follows: non-consented care (81%); right to information (72%); non-confidential care (69%); verbal abuse (35%); abandonment of care (32%); discriminatory care (15%); and physical abuse (15%). In overall analysis, experience of mistreatment was lower among women who were unemployed (β = -1.17, 95% CI -1.81, -0.53); and higher among less empowered women (β = 0.11, 95% CI 0.06, 0.16); and those assisted by a traditional birth attendant as opposed to a general physician (β = 0.94, 95% CI 0.13, 1.75). Sub-group analyses for home-based births identified the same significant associations with mistreatment, with ethnicity included. In facility-based births, there was a significant relationship between women’s employment and empowerment status and mistreatment. Women with prior education on birth preparedness were less likely to experience mistreatment compared to those who had received no previous birth preparedness education.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In order to promote care that is woman-centred and provided in a respectful and culturally appropriate manner, service providers should be cognisant of the current situation and ensure provision of quality antenatal care. At the community level, women should seek antenatal care for improved birth preparedness, while at the interpersonal level strategies should be devised to leverage women’s ability to participate in key household decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Waqas Hameed</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Waqas Hameed, Bilal Iqbal Avan&lt;/p&gt;

Despite increasing ability to store and analyze large amounts of data for organismal and ecological studies, the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images has largely remained time consuming and error-prone, particularly for tasks for which automation is difficult or impossible. Improving the efficiency of these tasks, which allows for more high quality data to be collected in a shorter amount of time, is therefore a high priority. The open-source web application, webpic, implements common web languages and widely available libraries and productivity apps to streamline the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images. In this paper, I introduce the framework of webpic and demonstrate one readily available feature of this application, linear measurements, using fossil leaf specimens. This application fills the gap between workflows accomplishable by individuals through existing software and those accomplishable by large, unmoderated crowds. It demonstrates that flexible web languages can be used to streamline time-intensive research tasks without the use of specialized equipment or proprietary software and highlights the potential for web resources to facilitate data collection in research tasks and outreach activities with improved efficiency.</content></content><author><name>Lucy M.

Childhood traumas, in the form of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect, are globally widespread and highly prevalent, and associated with a range of subsequent poor health outcomes. This study sought to understand the relationship between physical, sexual and emotional childhood abuse and subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people (18–30) living in urban informal settlements in Durban, South Africa. Data came from self-completed questionnaires amongst 680 women and 677 men comprising the baseline of the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention trial. Men and women were analysed separately. Logistic regression models assessed the relationship between six HIV-risk behaviours and four measures of trauma: the form of trauma, the severity of each trauma, the range of traumas, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Childhood traumas were incredibly prevalent in this population. All childhood traumas were associated with a range of HIV-risk behaviours. This was for the ever/never trauma, as well as the severity of each type of trauma, the range of trauma, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Despite the wider harsh contexts of urban informal settlements, childhood traumas still play a significant role in shaping subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people. Interventions to reduce childhood traumas for populations in informal settlements need to be developed. In addition, trauma focused therapies need to be considered as part of wider HIV-prevention interventions for young adults.

Background &lt;p&gt;Inequalities in health among groups of various socio-economic status (as measured by education, occupation, and income) constitute one of the main challenges for public health. Since 2006, the Lazio Regional Outcome Evaluation Program (P.Re.Val.E.), presents a set of indicators of hospital performance based on quality standards driven by strong clinical recommendations, and measures the variation in the access to effective health care for different population groups and providers in the Lazio Region. One of the aims of the program was to compare population subgroups in order to promote equity in service provision. Since June 2013, a new management strategy has been put in place that assigned specific goals based on performance assessment to the chief executive officers of the hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether, in recent years, there has been a reduction in the differential access to effective health care, among individuals with different educational levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We enrolled all patients discharged from both public and private hospitals of the Lazio region between 2012 and 2015, living in Lazio region. We analysed the proportion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes (primary PCI), the proportion of patients with hip fracture (HF) who underwent surgery within 2 days, and the proportion of women with primary C-section. We applied multivariate logistic regression models to assess the effect of educational level on health outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities that could affect the outcomes. For each year of the study period, we compared adjusted proportions of outcomes for the highest and the lowest level of education by using percentage differences.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, 44.6% of STEMI patients (N = 3,299) were treated with primary PCI, 54.4% of patients with hip fractures (N = 6,602) underwent surgery within 2 days, and 27.7% of women without a previous C-section (N = 34,718) delivered via C-section, in 2015. The corresponding proportions in 2012 were 27.8%, 31.3% and 31.5%, respectively. By comparing the adjusted proportions in patients with the highest education level (a university degree or higher) to those with the lowest level education level (None/Primary school), a decrease in the percentage difference was observed during the study period. In STEMI and delivery cohorts, the improvement of outcomes involved the least and the most educated patients, respectively, and the difference between the two educational levels was close to zero in 2015, whereas for hip patients, the improvement was more evident among the less educated patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, we observed a reduction in the differential access to effective heath care by educational level, in different clinical areas. Different factors might explain these results. On top of the public disclosure of outcome data, the management strategy applied in mid-2013 might have driven the overall improvement of the health system for the considered conditions, helping to achieve a fairer access to health.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Martina Ventura</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Ventura, Danilo Fusco, Katia Bontempi, Paola Colais, Marina Davoli&lt;/p&gt;

On top of the public disclosure of outcome data, the management strategy applied in mid-2013 might have driven the overall improvement of the health system for the considered conditions, helping to achieve a fairer access to health.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00216</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Cooperative Interactions of Three Hotspot Heparin Binding Residues Are Critical for Allosteric Activation of Antithrombin by Heparin</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00216</link><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_16277bc9f0b:10eb56e:76251cdd</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00216/20180329/images/medium/bi-2018-00216x_0011.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>456</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00216</originId><crawled>1522427272971</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c0b42144</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00216/20180329/images/medium/bi-2018-00216x_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00216&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Light causes damage to the retina (phototoxicity) and decreases photoreceptor responses to light. The most harmful component of visible light is the blue wavelength (400–500 nm). Different filters have been tested, but so far all of them allow passing a lot of this wavelength (70%). The aim of this work has been to prove that a filter that removes 94% of the blue component may protect the function and morphology of the retina significantly. Three experimental groups were designed. The first group was unexposed to light, the second one was exposed and the third one was exposed and protected by a blue-blocking filter. Light damage was induced in young albino mice (p30) by exposing them to white light of high intensity (5,000 lux) continuously for 7 days. Short wavelength light filters were used for light protection. The blue component was removed (94%) from the light source by our filter. Electroretinographical recordings were performed before and after light damage. Changes in retinal structure were studied using immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL labeling. Also, cells in the outer nuclear layer were counted and compared among the three different groups. Functional visual responses were significantly more conserved in protected animals (with the blue-blocking filter) than in unprotected animals. Also, retinal structure was better kept and photoreceptor survival was greater in protected animals, these differences were significant in central areas of the retina. Still, functional and morphological responses were significantly lower in protected than in unexposed groups. In conclusion, this blue-blocking filter decreases significantly photoreceptor damage after exposure to high intensity light. Actually, our eyes are exposed for a very long time to high levels of blue light (screens, artificial light LED, neons…). The potential damage caused by blue light can be palliated.</content></content><author><name>Javier Vicente-Tejedor</name></author><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Javier Vicente-Tejedor, Miguel Marchena, Laura Ramírez, Diego García-Ayuso, Violeta Gómez-Vicente, Celia Sánchez-Ramos, Pedro de la Villa, Francisco Germain&lt;/p&gt;

In Europe, responsible research and innovation (RRI) has emerged as a science policy measure that demands the early integration of a broad range of social actors and perspectives into research and development (R&amp;amp;D). More collaboration of the social sciences and humanities (SSH) with science and engineering appears within this policy framework as a crucial element that will enable better technological development. However, RRI is new to both natural scientists and SSH scholars, and interdisciplinary collaborations are challenging for many reasons. In this paper, we discuss these challenges while suggesting that what RRI can be in a particular project is not a given but remains an empirical question. Natural scientists and SSH scholars need to coresearch RRI in an experimental mode.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cWfW7Xi3ric&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Ana Delgado</name></author><crawled>1522086868168</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Delgado, Heidrun Åm&lt;/p&gt;

Our model demonstrates how PCx circuitry can implement multiplexed ensemble-identity/temporal-concentration odor coding.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Thermodynamically stable diatomic dications: The cases of SrO2+           and SrH2+</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018590?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88fa:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018590?af=R</originId><published>1522033740000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>16c769e1</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018590?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Levi Gonçalves dos Santos</name></author><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><title>Live imaging of DNA loop extrusion</title><engagementRate>0.02</engagementRate><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a52984a:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/44.6.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-f?rss=1</originId><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-f?rss=1</link><keywords><item>Biochemistry</item></keywords><fingerprint>38d83cc5</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-f?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><published>1522950073000</published></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Time-dependent regulation of morphological changes and cartilage differentiation markers in the mouse pubic symphysis during pregnancy and postpartum recovery</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195304</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460a:34f43e70</id><updated>1522962000000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195304</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195304</originId><published>1522962000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>eb48fb60</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195304</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Gazieri Castelucci, Sílvio Roberto Consonni, Viviane Souza Rosa, Lucimara Aparecida Sensiate, Paula Cristina Rugno Delatti, Lúcia Elvira Alvares, Paulo Pinto Joazeiro&lt;/p&gt;
Animal models commonly serve as a bridge between &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments and clinical applications; however, few physiological processes in adult animals are sufficient to serve as proof-of-concept models for cartilage regeneration. Intriguingly, some rodents, such as young adult mice, undergo physiological connective tissue modifications to birth canal elements such as the pubic symphysis during pregnancy; therefore, we investigated whether the differential expression of cartilage differentiation markers is associated with cartilaginous tissue morphological modifications during these changes. Our results showed that osteochondral progenitor cells expressing &lt;i&gt;Runx2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Col2a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dcx&lt;/i&gt; at the non-pregnant pubic symphysis proliferated and differentiated throughout pregnancy, giving rise to a complex osteoligamentous junction that attached the interpubic ligament to the pubic bones until labour occurred. After delivery, the recovery of pubic symphysis cartilaginous tissues was improved by the time-dependent expression of these chondrocytic lineage markers at the osteoligamentous junction. This process potentially recapitulates embryologic chondrocytic differentiation to successfully recover hyaline cartilaginous pads at 10 days postpartum. Therefore, we propose that this physiological phenomenon represents a proof-of-concept model for investigating the mechanisms involved in cartilage restoration in adult animals.</content></content><author><name>Bianca Gazieri Castelucci</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Gazieri Castelucci, Sílvio Roberto Consonni, Viviane Souza Rosa, Lucimara Aparecida Sensiate, Paula Cristina Rugno Delatti, Lúcia Elvira Alvares, Paulo Pinto Joazeiro&lt;/p&gt;

Numerical models for simulating outbreaks of infectious diseases are powerful tools for informing surveillance and control strategy decisions. However, large-scale spatially explicit models can be limited by the amount of computational resources they require, which poses a problem when multiple scenarios need to be explored to provide policy recommendations. We introduce an easily implemented method that can reduce computation time in a standard Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model without introducing any further approximations or truncations. It is based on a hierarchical infection process that operates on entire groups of spatially related nodes (cells in a grid) in order to efficiently filter out large volumes of susceptible nodes that would otherwise have required expensive calculations. After the filtering of the cells, only a subset of the nodes that were originally at risk are then evaluated for actual infection. The increase in efficiency is sensitive to the exact configuration of the grid, and we describe a simple method to find an estimate of the optimal configuration of a given landscape as well as a method to partition the landscape into a grid configuration. To investigate its efficiency, we compare the introduced methods to other algorithms and evaluate computation time, focusing on simulated outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) on the farm population of the USA, the UK and Sweden, as well as on three randomly generated populations with varying degree of clustering. The introduced method provided up to 500 times faster calculations than pairwise computation, and consistently performed as well or better than other available methods. This enables large scale, spatially explicit simulations such as for the entire continental USA without sacrificing realism or predictive power.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Oiar5aQKyTU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Stefan Sellman</name></author><crawled>1523036372641</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Sellman, Kimberly Tsao, Michael J.

Locomotion of machines and robots operating in rough terrain is strongly influenced by the mechanics of the ground-machine interactions. A rolling wheel in terrain with obstacles is subject to collisional energy losses, which is governed by mechanics comparable to hopping or walking locomotion. Here we investigate the energetic cost associated with overcoming an obstacle for rolling and hopping locomotion, using a simple mechanics model. The model considers collision-based interactions with the ground and the obstacle, without frictional losses, and we quantify, analyse, and compare the sources of energetic costs for three locomotion strategies. Our results show that the energetic advantages of the locomotion strategies are uniquely defined given the moment of inertia and the Froude number associated with the system. We find that hopping outperforms rolling at larger Froude numbers and vice versa. The analysis is further extended for a comparative study with animals. By applying size and inertial properties through an allometric scaling law of hopping and trotting animals to our models, we found that the conditions at which hopping becomes energetically advantageous to rolling roughly corresponds to animals’ preferred gait transition speeds. The energetic collision losses as predicted by the model are largely verified experimentally.</content></content><author><name>Fabio Giardina</name></author><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Giardina, Fumiya Iida&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the first step toward developing preventative strategies and optimizing care systems. We aimed to describe and compare epidemiological features and clinical outcomes among patients with anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs according to causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified emergency medical service (EMS)-treated anaphylaxis-associated OHCA patients from a nationwide OHCA registry between 2008 and 2015. We compared epidemiological characteristics and outcomes according to causal agents (a natural agents group and an iatrogenic agents group) and evaluated temporal variability in incidence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare survival to discharge between causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the study period (8 years), the total number of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs was 233. A total of 224 eligible cases were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients (85.6%) in the natural agents group and 32 patients (14.3%) in the iatrogenic agents group. There was significant diurnal and seasonal variability in the frequency of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values&amp;lt;0.01 for both), with the highest incidences occurring during the day (7:01 am to 3 pm; 64.6%) and in summer (June to August, 48.7%). Compared with the natural agents group, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for survival to discharge in the iatrogenic agents group was statistically insignificant (AOR 3.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 15.06).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is considerably low, and significant temporal variability, with a peak during the day and in summer, is evident. Anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is more common by natural agents than by iatrogenic agents, but no difference in the survival-to-discharge rate is evident.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Sun Young Lee</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sun Young Lee, Seung Chul Lee, Sang Do Shin, Kyoung Jun Song, Young Sun Ro, Jeong Ho Park, So Yeon Kong&lt;/p&gt;

In a search for new potential multitarget anti-HIV compounds from natural products, we have identified in &lt;i&gt;Hypericum scruglii&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic and exclusive species of Sardinia (Italy), a potent plant lead. The phytochemical study of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from its leaves led to the isolation of its most abundant secondary metabolites, belonging to different chemical classes. In particular, three phloroglucinols derivatives were identified, confirming their significance as chemotaxonomic markers of the &lt;i&gt;Hypericum&lt;/i&gt; genus. Among them, the 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol was reported here for the first time. All six isolated compounds have been evaluated firstly for the inhibition of both Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-associated DNA Polymerase (RDDP) and Ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities, for the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in biochemical assays, and also for their effect on viral replication. Among the isolated metabolites, three phloroglucinol derivatives and quercitrin were effective on both RT-associated RDDP and RNase H activities in biochemical assays. The same active compounds affected also HIV-1 IN strand transfer function, suggesting the involvement of the RNase H active site.

The phytochemical study of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from its leaves led to the isolation of its most abundant secondary metabolites, belonging to different chemical classes. In particular, three phloroglucinols derivatives were identified, confirming their significance as chemotaxonomic markers of the &lt;i&gt;Hypericum&lt;/i&gt; genus. Among them, the 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol was reported here for the first time. All six isolated compounds have been evaluated firstly for the inhibition of both Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-associated DNA Polymerase (RDDP) and Ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities, for the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in biochemical assays, and also for their effect on viral replication. Among the isolated metabolites, three phloroglucinol derivatives and quercitrin were effective on both RT-associated RDDP and RNase H activities in biochemical assays. The same active compounds affected also HIV-1 IN strand transfer function, suggesting the involvement of the RNase H active site. Furthermore, phloroglucinols compounds, included the newly identified compound, were able to inhibit the HIV-1 replication in cell based assays.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23687-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>InAs/AlGaAs quantum dots for single-photon emission in a red spectral range</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23687-7</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1626be58cb9:679a5cd:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23687-7/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23687_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>384</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23687-7</originId><published>1522220400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>58beba10</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/vMdMi_08yw8/s41598-018-23687-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;InAs/AlGaAs quantum dots for single-photon emission in a red spectral range&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InAs/AlGaAs quantum dots for single-photon emission in a red spectral range, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23687-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23687-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;InAs/AlGaAs quantum dots for single-photon emission in a red spectral range&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vMdMi_08yw8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>M.

We investigated the effect of auditory noise added to speech on patterns of looking at faces in 40 toddlers. We hypothesised that noise would increase the difficulty of processing speech, making children allocate more attention to the mouth of the speaker to gain visual speech cues from mouth movements. We also hypothesised that this shift would cause a decrease in fixation time to the eyes, potentially decreasing the ability to monitor gaze. We found that adding noise increased the number of fixations to the mouth area, at the price of a decreased number of fixations to the eyes. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a mouth-eyes trade-off between attention allocated to social cues coming from the eyes and linguistic cues coming from the mouth. We also found that children with higher word recognition proficiency and higher average pupil response had an increased likelihood of fixating the mouth, compared to the eyes and the rest of the screen, indicating stronger motivation to decode the speech.</content></content><author><name>Magdalena Ewa Król</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Magdalena Ewa Król&lt;/p&gt;

Deformed wing virus (DWV) is an important pathogen in a broad range of insects, including honey bees. Concordant with the spread of &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt;, DWV is present in the majority of honey bee colonies and can result in either low-level infections with asymptomatic bees that nonetheless exhibit increased colony loss under stress, or high-level infections with acute effects on bee health and viability. DWV can be transmitted vertically or horizontally and evidence suggests that horizontal transmission via &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt; is associated with acute symptomatic infections. Vertical transmission also occurs and is presumably important for the maintenance of DWV in honey bee populations. To further our understanding the vertical transmission of DWV through queens, we performed three experiments: we studied the quantitative effectiveness of vertical transmission, surveyed the prevalence of successful egg infection under commercial conditions, and distinguished among three possible mechanisms of transmission. We find that queen-infection level predicts the DWV titers in their eggs, although the transmission is not very efficient. Our quantitative assessment of DWV demonstrates that eggs in 1/3 of the colonies are infected with DWV and highly infected eggs are rare in newly-installed spring colonies. Additionally, our results indicate that DWV transmission occurs predominantly by virus adhering to the surface of eggs (transovum) rather than intracellularly. Our combined results suggest that the queens’ DWV vectoring capacity in practice is not as high as its theoretical potential. Thus, DWV transmission by honey bee queens is part of the DWV epidemic with relevant practical implications, which should be further studied.</content></content><author><name>Esmaeil Amiri</name></author><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Esmaeil Amiri, Per Kryger, Marina D.

It seems that faba bean (FB) seeds could be a good protein-energy component in animal feed, but the presence of anti-nutritional substances limits their use as a substitute of soybean meal. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of different concentrations of raw, low-tannin, FB seeds on the gut-bone axis in Ross 308 broilers. One-day old chickens were randomly subjected to one of the 3 dietary treatments: the control group was fed standard diet based on soybean meal and without FB seeds, and two groups were fed 8%/15% and 16%/22% of raw low-tannin FB seeds in the starter and grower, respectively. On the 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, hematological and serum biochemical analyses as well histomorphometry of the small intestine and liver tissue and bone mechanical tests were performed. The diet type had no effect on the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. However, the basal intestinal structures were significantly reduced in birds fed the lower concentration of FB. The enlargement of nerve plexuses was dependent on the concentration used in the diet and, additionally, on the kind of plexus and location in the intestinal tract. The liver was characterized by an increase in non-hepatocytes. There was no influence of the low-tannin FB seeds on most of the analyzed serum parameters in the 35-day-old broiler chickens, except the decreased concentration of total cholesterol and Ca in both experimental groups, triglycerides in group I, and P and uric acid in group II. Furthermore, the increasing concentration of the dietary low-tannin FB did not influence the activities of AspAT (except the group fed the higher amount of FB), ALAT, and LDH. The broiler chickens had no visible leg lesions and no problem in the locomotor function, but the tibiae were lighter mainly in birds fed the higher concentration of FB seeds. Geometric analysis revealed reduction of the cross section area and wall thickness, indicating a decline in the bone midshaft, which influenced the densitometric parameters and the results of mechanical tests. In conclusion, the dietary inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seeds had no negative effects on broiler growth, but disturbed the intestine structure and tibia characteristics. Therefore, all these negative effects necessitate additional examinations before inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seed into poultry diet.</content></content><author><name>Ewa Tomaszewska</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ewa Tomaszewska, Piotr Dobrowolski, Renata Klebaniuk, Małgorzata Kwiecień, Agnieszka Tomczyk-Warunek, Sylwia Szymańczyk, Sylwester Kowalik, Anna Milczarek, Tomasz Blicharski, Siemowit Muszyński&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Maternal morbidity and mortality is still a major public health issue in low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Improving access to antenatal care (ANC) services for pregnant women has been widely recognized as one of the most effective means of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity. As such, this study examined the barriers for pregnant women living in rural, agricultural villages to accessing ANC based on data collected in the Ratanakiri province, one of the least developed provinces in Cambodia, using a combination of a community-based cross-sectional survey and a geographic information system (GIS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 377 mothers with children under the age of two living in 62 villages in the Ratanakiri province, Cambodia, in December 2015. Face-to-face interviews were conducted to ask mothers about their ANC service use, knowledge of ANC, barriers to accessing health facilities, and complications they experienced during the most recent pregnancy. At the same time, GIS data were also collected using a Global Positioning System (GPS) to accurately measure actual travel distance of pregnant women to access health facilities and to examine geographical and environmental barriers in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Only a third of the mothers met the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) of receiving ANC four times or more (achieved ANC4+), and a quarter of the mothers had never received ANC during their most recent pregnancy. Factors positively associated with achieving ANC4+ were mother’s secondary or higher education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.74, 17.37), being aware that receiving ANC is recommended (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.25, 6.00), and knowledge about the recommended frequency for ANC (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI: 7.22). Actual travel distance was negatively associated with achieving ANC4+. Mothers who had to travel 10.0–14.9 km were 68% less likely (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10, 0.99), and those who had to travel 15.0 km or longer were 79% less likely (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.62) to have achieved ANC 4+, both compared to those who travelled 5.0 km or less. While most previous studies have used a straight-line to measure distance traveled, this study much more accurately measured the actual distance traveled by using a GIS. As a result, there was a statistically significant discrepancy between actual travel distance and straight-line distance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study revealed promoting factors and barriers for ANC use among pregnant women living in remote, agricultural villages in Cambodia. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of measuring travel distances accurately to ensure that targeted interventions for ANC are not misguided by straight-line distances. The methodology used in this study can be applied widely to other developing countries, especially in remote areas with limited road networks where there may be a large discrepancy between actual and straight-line distances.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Junko Yasuoka</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junko Yasuoka, Keiko Nanishi, Kimiyo Kikuchi, Sumihiro Suzuki, Po Ly, Boukheng Thavrin, Tsutomu Omatsu, Tetsuya Mizutani&lt;/p&gt;

Due to low efficacy of classic antimicrobial drugs, finding new active preparations attracts much attention. In this study an innovative, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method was applied to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using filamentous fungi &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium robertsii&lt;/i&gt; biomass waste. It was shown that these NPs possess prominent antifungal effects against &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glabrata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parapsilosis&lt;/i&gt; reference strains. Further detailed studies were performed on &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 90028.

Due to low efficacy of classic antimicrobial drugs, finding new active preparations attracts much attention. In this study an innovative, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method was applied to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using filamentous fungi &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium robertsii&lt;/i&gt; biomass waste. It was shown that these NPs possess prominent antifungal effects against &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glabrata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parapsilosis&lt;/i&gt; reference strains. Further detailed studies were performed on &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 90028. AgNPs kill curve (CFU method and esterase-mediated reduction of fluorescein diacetate); fractionally inhibitory concentration index (FICI) with fluconazole (FLC); effect on fungal cell membrane permeability (propidium iodide (PI) staining), membrane lipids profile (HPLC-MS), yeast morphotypes and intracellular reactive oxygen species level (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DCFDA probe) were investigated.

Hydraulic fracturing can improve the permeability of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs effectively, which is of great significance to the commercial production of CBM. However, the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing is affected by multiple factors. The mechanism of fracture initiation, morphology and propagation in CBM reservoirs is not clear and need to be further explored. Hydraulic fracturing experiment is an accurate tool to explore these mechanisms. The quantity of experimental coal rock is large and processing method is complex, so specimen made of similar materials was applied to replace coal rock. The true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experimental apparatus, 3D scanning device for coal rock section were applied to carry out hydraulic fracturing experiment. The results show that the initiation pressure is inversely proportional to the horizontal stress difference (Δσ) and positively related to fracturing fluid injection rate. When vertical stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) is constant, the initiation pressure and fracture width decrease with the increasing of Δσ. Natural fractures can be connected by main fracture when propagates perpendicular to the direction of minimum horizontal stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;), then secondary fractures and fracture network form in CBM reservoirs. When two stresses of crustal stress are close and far different from the third one, the fracture morphology and propagation become complex. Influenced by perforations and filtration of fracturing fluid in specimen, fracturing fluid flows to downward easily after comparing horizontal well fracturing with vertical well fracturing. Fracture width increases with the decreasing of elastic modulus, the intensity of fracture is positively related with the elastic modulus of coal rock. The research results can provide theoretical basis and technical support for the efficient development of CBM.</content></content><author><name>Fan Zhang</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fan Zhang, Geng Ma, Xiao Liu, Yunqi Tao, Dan Feng, Rui Li&lt;/p&gt;

FOXQ1 is a member of the forkhead-box transcription factor family that has important functions in development, cancer, aging, and many cellular processes. The role of FOXQ1 in cancer biology has raised intense interest, yet much remains poorly understood. We investigated the possible function of the two zebrafish orthologs (&lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;foxq1b&lt;/i&gt;) of human FOXQ1 in innate immune cell development and function. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutagenesis to create null mutations of &lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;foxq1b&lt;/i&gt; in zebrafish. Using a combination of molecular, cellular, and embryological approaches, we characterized single and double &lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;bcz11&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;foxq1b&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;bcz18&lt;/sup&gt; mutants. This study provides the first genetic mutant analyses of zebrafish &lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;foxq1b&lt;/i&gt;. Interestingly, we found that &lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt;, but not &lt;i&gt;foxq1b&lt;/i&gt;, was transcriptionally regulated during a bacterial response, while the expression of &lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt; was detected in sorted macrophages and upregulated in &lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mutants. However, the transcriptional response to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; challenge of &lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;foxq1b&lt;/i&gt; mutants was not significantly different from that of their wildtype control siblings. Our data shows that &lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt; may have a role in modulating bacterial response, while both &lt;i&gt;foxq1a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;foxq1b&lt;/i&gt; are not required for the development of macrophages, neutrophils, and microglia.

Recent studies have demonstrated how the competition for the finite pool of available gene expression factors has important effect on fundamental gene expression aspects. In this study, based on a whole-cell model simulation of translation in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, we evaluate for the first time the expected effect of mRNA levels fluctuations on translation due to the finite pool of ribosomes. We show that fluctuations of a single gene or a group of genes mRNA levels induce periodic behavior in all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; translation factors and aspects: the ribosomal densities and the translation rates of all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs oscillate. We numerically measure the oscillation amplitudes demonstrating that fluctuations of endogenous and heterologous genes can cause a significant fluctuation of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of the rest of the genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by synonymous mutations that oscillating the levels of mRNAs that experience high ribosomal occupancy (e.g. ribosomal “traffic jam”) induces the largest impact on the translation of the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; genome.
The results reported here should provide novel insights and principles related to the design of synthetic gene expression circuits and related to the evolutionary constraints shaping gene expression of endogenous genes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EeyF-2L0x-k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yoram Zarai</name></author><crawled>1522777258471</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoram Zarai, Tamir Tuller&lt;/p&gt;

This method’s tolerance of fluoroalkyl substituents proved particularly advantageous for the streamlined preparation of pharmaceutically oriented fluorinated scaffolds that previously required multiple steps, toxic reagents, and nonmodular retrosynthetic blueprints. Five specific sulfone reagents facilitate the rapid assembly of a vast set of compounds, many of which contain challenging fluorination patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>388</engagement><title>How human embryonic stem cells sparked a revolution</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03268-4</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16243c24c6e:2f4b43e:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03268-4/d41586-018-03268-4_15545010.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03268-4</originId><published>1521529200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b75a907</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03268-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How human embryonic stem cells sparked a revolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How human embryonic stem cells sparked a revolution, Published online: 20 March 2018;

Globally, the number of dengue cases has been on the increase since 1990 and this trend has also been found in Brazil and its most populated city—São Paulo. Surveillance systems based on predictions allow for timely decision making processes, and in turn, timely and efficient interventions to reduce the burden of the disease. We conducted a comparative study of dengue predictions in São Paulo city to test the performance of trained seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, generalized additive models and artificial neural networks. We also used a naïve model as a benchmark. A generalized additive model with lags of the number of cases and meteorological variables had the best performance, predicted epidemics of unprecedented magnitude and its performance was 3.16 times higher than the benchmark and 1.47 higher that the next best performing model. The predictive models captured the seasonal patterns but differed in their capacity to anticipate large epidemics and all outperformed the benchmark. In addition to be able to predict epidemics of unprecedented magnitude, the best model had computational advantages, since its training and tuning was straightforward and required seconds or at most few minutes. These are desired characteristics to provide timely results for decision makers. However, it should be noted that predictions are made just one month ahead and this is a limitation that future studies could try to reduce.</content></content><author><name>Oswaldo Santos Baquero</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Oswaldo Santos Baquero, Lidia Maria Reis Santana, Francisco Chiaravalloti-Neto&lt;/p&gt;

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes progressive disability in 1 of every 5,000 boys due to the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Despite much advancement in knowledge about DMD disease presentation and progression—attributable in part to studies using mouse and canine models of the disease–current DMD treatments are not equally effective in all patients. There remains, therefore, a need for translational animal models in which novel treatment targets can be identified and evaluated. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of DMD. As with DMD, speed of disease progression in GRMD varies substantially. However, unlike DMD, all GRMD dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the GRMD dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 GRMD dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which GRMD stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with DMD and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of GRMD as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) in faster-progressing GRMD dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in GRMD and DMD. In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research.</content></content><author><name>Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford, Candice Chu, Cynthia Balog-Alvarez, Xue Yu, James J.

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses. The most prominent effect was decreased pelvic rise that occurred as the rider was actively rising up in the stirrups, thus creating a downward momentum counteracting the horses push off. This mimics a push off lameness in the hindlimb that is in stance when the rider sits down in the saddle during the rising trot. On the circle, the asymmetries induced by rising trot on the correct diagonal counteracted the circle induced asymmetries, rendering the horse more symmetrical. This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness. This theory needs to be studied further in clinically lame horses.</content></content><author><name>Emma Persson-Sjodin</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Persson-Sjodin, Elin Hernlund, Thilo Pfau, Pia Haubro Andersen, Marie Rhodin&lt;/p&gt;

There is a suspected but unproven association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and subjective stress, depressive disorders, health-related quality of life (QoL) and suicide. We selected 124,205 adults from the Korean Community Health Survey in 2013 who were at least 19 years old and who had lived in their current domiciles for &gt; five years. Based on the computer-assisted personal interviews to measure subjective stress in daily life, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, depression diagnosis by a doctor, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts, we evaluated the risk of mental disorders using multiple logistic regression analysis according to the quartiles of air pollutants, such as particulate matter &amp;lt;10μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, using yearly average concentration between August 2012 and July 2013. The prevalence of high stress, poor QoL, depressiveness, diagnosis of depression, and suicide ideation was positively associated with high concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO after adjusting for confounding factors. Men were at increased risk of stress, poor QoL, and depressiveness from air pollution exposure than were women. The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects &amp;lt; age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation.</content></content><author><name>Jinyoung Shin</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinyoung Shin, Jin Young Park, Jaekyung Choi&lt;/p&gt;

The prevalence of high stress, poor QoL, depressiveness, diagnosis of depression, and suicide ideation was positively associated with high concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO after adjusting for confounding factors. Men were at increased risk of stress, poor QoL, and depressiveness from air pollution exposure than were women. The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects &amp;lt; age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16203</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Author Correction: The scaffold protein p140Cap limits ERBB2-mediated breast cancer progression interfering with Rac GTPase-controlled circuitries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16203</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162764edef1:7865ba3:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16203</originId><published>1522393200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>46d37f97</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/R5xQg2uALUw/ncomms16203</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: The scaffold protein p140Cap limits ERBB2-mediated breast cancer progression interfering with Rac GTPase-controlled circuitries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: The scaffold protein p140Cap limits ERBB2-mediated breast cancer progression interfering with Rac GTPase-controlled circuitries, Published online: 30 March 2018;

Metabolic engineering focuses on rewriting the metabolism of cells to enhance native products or endow cells with the ability to produce new products. This engineering has the potential for wide-range application, including the production of fuels, chemicals, foods and pharmaceuticals. Glycolysis manages the levels of various secondary metabolites by controlling the supply of glycolytic metabolites. Metabolic reprogramming of glycolysis is expected to cause an increase in the secondary metabolites of interest. In this study, we constructed a budding yeast strain harboring the combination of triple sirtuin gene deletion (&lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆) and interruption of gluconeogenesis by the deletion of the &lt;i&gt;FBP1&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (&lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆). &lt;i&gt;hst3&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;hst4&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;sir2&lt;/i&gt;∆ &lt;i&gt;fbp1&lt;/i&gt;∆ cells harbored active glycolysis with high glucose consumption and active ethanol productivity.

Background &lt;p&gt;Knowledge of tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes is substantially needed to assess the performance of national TB controls programs (NTPs). To date, the overall estimates of treatment outcomes have not been determined in Ethiopia. Therefore, this meta-analysis was undertaken to produce pooled estimates of TB treatment outcomes and to analyze the impact of prior anti-TB drug exposure and HIV co-infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Potentially relevant studies were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE online databases. The unpublished studies have been retrieved from the grey literature through Google and Google Scholar. The pooled estimates were calculated using random effect model. The summary estimates were also presented using Forest plots and Tables. The outcome measures were successful and unsuccessful treatment outcomes. Patients who were cured or with completed treatment defined as successful treatment outcome and patients meeting the definition of death, defaulting and failure are considered as unsuccessfully treated cases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 34 studies are included for meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of successful TB treatment outcomes amounts to 83.7% (95% CI 81.1%–86.3%). Of successfully treated cases, 33.9% were cured and the remaining completed cases. Besides, among patients with unsuccessful treatment outcome, nearly 50% were dead and the rest were treatment failures and defaulters. Sub-group analysis shows that high treatment success rate was estimated in Afar; 88.9% (95% CI 83.8%–94.2%), followed by Oromia; 88.5% (95% CI 82.6%–94.5%) and Gambella; 86.1% (95% CI 84.4%–87.9%), whereas relatively poor treatment outcome was noted in Tigray; 20.0% (95% CI 2.1%–37.9%) and Amhara; 19.0% (95% CI 12.6%–25.5%). The unsuccessful TB treatment outcome was found to be higher among HIV/TB co-infected cases with an odds ratio of 1.98 (95%CI, 1.56–2.52) and re-treated cases with an odds ratio of 2.17 (95%CI, 1.55–3.03). The time trend was assessed from 2003 to 2016, but it shows insignificant variation with treatment outcome (P = 0.108).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The rate of successful treatment outcome in Ethiopia appears generally high, only slightly below the threshold suggested by the World Health Organization. History of tuberculosis treatment and HIV/TB co-infection were inversely associated with favorable treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Setegn Eshetie</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Setegn Eshetie, Mucheye Gizachew, Animut Alebel, Dick van Soolingen&lt;/p&gt;

Ocular tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes severe inflammation and vision loss in TB-endemic countries. The mechanism by which tuberculous infection becomes established in the eye is poorly understood. We have developed the zebrafish larva infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; as a model to study the early pathogenesis of ocular TB. We find that hematogenous bacterial seeding of the eye occurs despite a functional blood retinal barrier. Prototypical early granulomas form in response to bacteria in the eye. These granulomas involve the retinal vasculature and retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex which are characteristic locations for human ocular TB. We find that peripheral blood monocytes are recruited to the nascent ocular granuloma further suggesting that the immune privileged nature of the eye is breached by this inflammatory focus.</content></content><author><name>Kevin Takaki</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Takaki, Lalita Ramakrishnan, Soumyava Basu&lt;/p&gt;

Body size governs predator-prey interactions, which in turn structure populations, communities, and food webs. Understanding predator-prey size relationships is valuable from a theoretical perspective, in basic research, and for management applications. However, predator-prey size data are limited and costly to acquire. We quantified predator-prey total length and mass relationships for several freshwater piscivorous taxa: crappie (&lt;i&gt;Pomoxis&lt;/i&gt; spp.), largemouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus salmoides&lt;/i&gt;), muskellunge (&lt;i&gt;Esox masquinongy&lt;/i&gt;), northern pike (&lt;i&gt;Esox lucius&lt;/i&gt;), rock bass (&lt;i&gt;Ambloplites rupestris&lt;/i&gt;), smallmouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus dolomieu&lt;/i&gt;), and walleye (&lt;i&gt;Sander vitreus&lt;/i&gt;). The range of prey total lengths increased with predator total length. The median and maximum ingested prey total length varied with predator taxon and length, but generally ranged from 10–20% and 32–46% of predator total length, respectively. Predators tended to consume larger fusiform prey than laterally compressed prey. With the exception of large muskellunge, predators most commonly consumed prey between 16 and 73 mm. A sensitivity analysis indicated estimates can be very accurate at sample sizes greater than 1,000 diet items and fairly accurate at sample sizes greater than 100. However, sample sizes less than 50 should be evaluated with caution. Furthermore, median log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; predator-prey body mass ratios ranged from 1.9–2.5, nearly 50% lower than values previously reported for freshwater fishes. Managers, researchers, and modelers could use our findings as a tool for numerous predator-prey evaluations from stocking size optimization to individual-based bioenergetics analyses identifying prey size structure. To this end, we have developed a web-based user interface to maximize the utility of our models that can be found at www.LakeEcologyLab.org/pred_prey.</content></content><author><name>Jereme W.

Heparan sulfate 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfotransferases (HS3STs) catalyze the final maturation step of heparan sulfates. Although seven HS3ST isozymes have been described in human, 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfation is a relatively rare modification, and only a few biological processes have been described to be influenced by 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfated motifs. A conflicting literature has recently reported that HS3ST2, 3A, 3B and 4 may exhibit either tumor-promoting or anti-oncogenic properties, depending on the model used and cancer cell phenotype. Hence, we decided to compare the consequences of the overexpression of each of these HS3STs in the same cellular model. We demonstrated that, unlike HS3ST3A, the other three isozymes enhanced the proliferation of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells. Moreover, the colony forming capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells was markedly increased by the expression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4. No notable difference was observed between the three isozymes, meaning that the modifications catalyzed by each HS3ST had the same functional impact on cell behavior. We then demonstrated that overexpression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4 was accompanied by increased activation of c-Src, Akt and NF-κB and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and XIAP. In line with these findings, we showed that HS3ST-transfected cells are more resistant to cell death induction by pro-apoptotic stimuli or NK cells. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that HS3ST2, 3B and 4 share the same pro-tumoral activity and support the idea that these HS3STs could compensate each other for loss of their expression depending on the molecular signature of cancer cells and/or changes in the tumor environment.</content></content><author><name>Charles Hellec</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charles Hellec, Maxime Delos, Mathieu Carpentier, Agnès Denys, Fabrice Allain&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has a reported greater prevalence and poorer treatment outcomes in people living with HIV (PLWH) than comparable HIV-uninfected cohorts. We conducted a cross-sectional study to delineate the factors driving T2D in PLWH in an ethnically diverse cohort, and additionally observed how these have changed over time.&lt;/p&gt; Setting &lt;p&gt;We studied a diverse HIV cohort in London to determine the prevalence and risk factors for T2D, and compared them to a cohort studied 10 years previously.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients were classified as normoglycaemic (fasting glucose &amp;lt;6.0 mmol/l) or dysglycaemic (≥6.0 mmol/l). The relative contribution to dysglycaemia of modifiable and fixed factors, including demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, immune status, and HIV therapy, were analysed using univariate and logistic regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;T2D prevalence was 15.1% in 2015 with a relative risk of 2.4 compared to the general population. The prevalence compared to 6.8% ten years earlier. The 2015 versus the 2005 cohort was significantly older (median age 49 (42–57) years versus 41 (IQR 35–47), p&amp;lt;0.001), had a higher BMI (27.4 (23.3–29.9) versus 24.9 (22.4–28.0) kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, p = 0.019) and hypertensive (37.9% versus 19.6 respectively, p&amp;lt;0.001). The strongest predictors of dysglycaemia in the 2015 cohort were hepatic steatosis and hypertension, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) 6.74 (3.48–13.03) and 2.92 (1.66–5.16) respectively, and also HIV-related factors of weight gain following antiretroviral initiation and longer known duration of HIV infection (OR 1.07 (1.04–1.11) and 1.06 (1.02–1.10) respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The alarmingly high prevalence of T2D in HIV requires improved screening, targeted to older patients and those with a longer duration of exposure to antiretrovirals. Effective diabetes prevention and management strategies are needed urgently to reduce this risk; such interventions should target both conventional risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, and HIV-specific risk factors such as weight gain following initiation of antiretrovirals.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Alastair D.

The 2015 versus the 2005 cohort was significantly older (median age 49 (42–57) years versus 41 (IQR 35–47), p&amp;lt;0.001), had a higher BMI (27.4 (23.3–29.9) versus 24.9 (22.4–28.0) kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, p = 0.019) and hypertensive (37.9% versus 19.6 respectively, p&amp;lt;0.001). The strongest predictors of dysglycaemia in the 2015 cohort were hepatic steatosis and hypertension, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) 6.74 (3.48–13.03) and 2.92 (1.66–5.16) respectively, and also HIV-related factors of weight gain following antiretroviral initiation and longer known duration of HIV infection (OR 1.07 (1.04–1.11) and 1.06 (1.02–1.10) respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The alarmingly high prevalence of T2D in HIV requires improved screening, targeted to older patients and those with a longer duration of exposure to antiretrovirals. Effective diabetes prevention and management strategies are needed urgently to reduce this risk; such interventions should target both conventional risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, and HIV-specific risk factors such as weight gain following initiation of antiretrovirals.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Effect of environmental factors on the germination and emergence of &amp;lt;i&gt;Salvia verbenaca&amp;lt;/i&gt; L. cultivars (&amp;lt;i&gt;verbenaca&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;vernalis&amp;lt;/i&gt;): An invasive species in semi-arid and arid rangeland regions</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194319</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:412391e:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1521752400000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194319</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194319</originId><published>1521752400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>38320c7d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194319</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Mansoor Javaid, Singarayer Florentine, Hafiz Haider Ali, Sandra Weller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Salvia verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; (wild sage) is a commonly cultivated herbal medicine plant, which is native to the Mediterranean climate regions of Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. However, it has become an invasive species in semi-arid and arid regions of southern Australia. Two varieties are present in this region, var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; and var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt;, each of which can be distinguished by differences in morphology and flowering period. Following trials to determine the optimum temperate regime for germination and response to light and dark, seeds of both varieties were tested for their response to variations in pH, moisture stress, salinity, and burial depth. The temperature and light trial was carried out using three different temperature regimes; 30/20°C, 25/15°C and 20/12°C, and two light regimes; 12 hours light/12 hours dark and 24 hours dark, with var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; responding to relatively higher temperatures than var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. The germination rate of neither species was significantly inhibited by complete darkness when compared to rates under periodic light exposure. Both varieties germinated at near optimum rates strongly to very strongly in all pH buffer solutions, from pH 5 to pH 10, but they responded most strongly at neutral pH. Var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; showed slightly more tolerance to reduced moisture availability, moderate to strong salinity, and burial depth, compared to var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. However, even a fairly shallow burial depth of 2 cm completely inhibited germination of both varieties. Thus, in circumstances where both varieties are present in a soil seedbank, var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; could be expected to establish in more challenging conditions, where moisture is limited and salinity is ‘moderate to high’, implying that it is a more serious threat for invasive weed in conditions where crop plants are already challenged.</content></content><author><name>Muhammad Mansoor Javaid</name></author><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Mansoor Javaid, Singarayer Florentine, Hafiz Haider Ali, Sandra Weller&lt;/p&gt;

During the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century the discussion on early human behavioral patterns revolved around the &lt;i&gt;hunting versus scavenging&lt;/i&gt; debate. The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks– 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores–were virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished.</content></content><author><name>José Yravedra</name></author><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by José Yravedra, Julia Aramendi, Miguel Ángel Maté-González, Lloyd Austin Courtenay, Diego González-Aguilera&lt;/p&gt;

An epidemiological model is presented that provides a comprehensive description of the transmission pathways involved for recurrent tuberculosis (TB), whereby cured individuals can become reinfected. Our main goal is to determine conditions that lead to the appearance of a backward bifurcation. This occurs when an asymptotically stable infection free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable non-trivial equilibria even though the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is less than unity. Although, some 10-30% cases of TB are recurrent, the role of recurrent TB as far as the formation of backward bifurcation is concerned, is rarely if ever studied. The model used here incorporates progressive primary infection, exogenous reinfection, endogenous reactivation and recurrent TB as transmission mechanisms that contribute to TB progression. Unlike other studies of TB dynamics that make use of frequency dependent transmission rates, our analysis provides exact backward bifurcation threshold conditions without resorting to commonly applied approximations and simplifying assumptions. Exploration of the model through analytical and numerical analysis reveal that recurrent TB is sometimes capable of triggering hysteresis effects which allow TB to persist when &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 1 even though there is no backward bifurcation.

The theory has been that these are always going to be in there fighting against your efforts to kill off the downstream tumor cells, so unless you find a way to target them, you’re not going to be successful. As that blog post shows, though, this area was imperfectly understood at the time, and it has not gotten a great deal more clear since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company that I wrote about, though, Stemcentrx, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/04/28/stemcentrx-scooped-up&quot;&gt;bought a few months later&lt;/a&gt; by AbbVie for &lt;em&gt;5.8 billion dollars in cash&lt;/em&gt; (and promises of about four billion more if things worked out). At the time, I wrote (uncontroversially, I think) that “this deal is going to end up looking either very smart or very stupid”. The lead program out of this deal, Rova-T, is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4934375/&quot;&gt;antibody-drug&lt;/a&gt; conjugate (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovalpituzumab_tesirine&quot;&gt;rovalpituzumab tesirine&lt;/a&gt;) which was aimed at small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL3&quot;&gt;DLL3&lt;/a&gt; protein found on the surface of some cell types. The antibody targets DLL, and the conjugate has a cleavable linker that delivers a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer as a DNA-damaging payload. SCLC is bad news, so any advances in this field would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on in 2016, AbbVie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/abbvie-turns-its-first-card-bold-10b-gamble-rova-t&quot;&gt;presented data&lt;/a&gt; from a small trial (I believe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(16)30565-4/fulltext&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) that showed that response rates did seem to correlate with DLL3 expression. But the rates themselves were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2016/06/05/abbvies-new-lung-cancer-drug-may-extend-patients-lives-but-could-disappoint-investors/#64bce5bf7c53&quot;&gt;not all that impressive&lt;/a&gt;, in the larger scheme of things, and overall, people didn’t seem very impressed. AbbVie pushed on, though, seeking accelerated approval from the FDA, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/abbvie-shares-tank-on-rova-t-flop-retreat-from-accelerated-approval-pitch/&quot;&gt;today we have the latest results&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately. The company reported the response rate from the DLL3-high patient group, and it’s only 16% (which is the same or worse than standard of care response rates), and the survival data are not impressive, either. &lt;em&gt;(Update: it’s quite likely that this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://epvantage.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&amp;id=774872&amp;isEPVantage=yes&quot;&gt;even worse&lt;/a&gt; than it seems!)&lt;/em&gt; The stock market is not taking this well. ABBV is down $12 a share as I write, which takes out nearly $20 billion dollars of market cap from the stock. The fear is that if this is the DLL3-high group, which is supposed to be the best of the bunch, what are the full Phase 3 results going to look like? Forget about accelerated approval – AbbVie sure has to – what are the chances that this program works well enough to be approved at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also puts a bit of a hole in the cancer-stem-cell idea in general. It’s a complicated enough field that you’re not going to disprove it with a single agent or in a single type of cancer, but this does show that it’s not even as straightforward as it looks (and it didn’t look that straightforward!) As for this specific approach, and this specific deal, well. . .I suppose things could change eventually, but for now, it’s a disaster. We’ll see what AbbVie does after the full data come out. . .&lt;/p&gt;

The substitution of fish resources as ingredients for aquafeeds by those based on vegetable sources is needed to ensure aquaculture sustainability in the future. It is known that Senegalese sole (&lt;i&gt;Solea senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;) accepts high dietary content of plant ingredients without altering growth or flesh quality parameters. However, scarce information is available regarding the long-term impact of vegetable diets (combining the inclusion of both vegetable protein and oils) on the stress response and immunity of this fish species. This study aims to evaluate the concomitant effect of the extended use of vegetable protein-based diets with fish oil (FO) replacement (0, 50 or 100%) by vegetable oils (VO), on the response to acute (10 min) or prolonged (4 days) stress, induced by thermal shock. Plasma levels of cortisol, glucose and lactate as well as hepatic levels of glucose, glycogen and lactate were evaluated as primary and secondary responses to stress, 6 and 18 months after feeding the experimental diets (6 and 18 MAF). The brain monoaminergic activity in telencephalon and hypothalamus, and non-specific immune parameters were also evaluated. As expected, thermal shock induced an increase in values of plasma parameters related to stress, which was more evident in acute than in prolonged stress. Stress also affected lactate levels in the liver and the values of the alternative complement pathway-ACH50 in the plasma. Dietary substitution of FO induced an effect &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on some parameters such as decreased hepatic glucose and glycogen levels and peroxidase activity in plasma as well enhanced serotonergic activity in brain of non-stressed fish. The results obtained in some parameters indicate that there is an interaction between the use of vegetable diets with the physiological response to thermal stress, as is the case of the hepatic lactate, serotonergic neurotransmission in brain, and the activity of ACH50 in plasma. These results suggest that the inclusion of VO in plant protein based diets point to a slightly inhibited stress response, more evident for an acute than a prolonged stress.</content></content><author><name>Marta Conde-Sieira</name></author><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Conde-Sieira, Manuel Gesto, Sónia Batista, Fátima Linares, José L.

Academic misconduct/dishonesty has become widespread behavior among many university students across the globe, and medical education is not an exception. Until recently, few efforts have been made to study the dishonest behavior in Middle-Eastern universities. This study examined the prevalence and predisposing factors of cheating among medical students in Saudi Arabia and suggests suitable preventive measures. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at a government medical college during the 2014–2015 academic year. The response rate was 58.5% (421/720). The overall cheating behavior practiced by the participants was 29%, predominantly by male students. High GPA scoring students were the least likely to cheat. The participants living with their families were more likely to cheat compared to those who were living apart from their families. The reasons participants gave to justify their cheating behavior included getting better grades, passing the course, and lacking preparation while still recognizing that cheating is a ‘mistake.’ Overall, significant academic misconduct concerning cheating was found among the Saudi medical students; this misconduct is alarming in a reputable government institution. The implementation of strict punishments, requiring ethical courses and creating ethical awareness by exploiting the potential of Islamic religious belief might help to control this problem.</content></content><author><name>Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani</name></author><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani, Shafiul Haque, Yousef Abdullah Almusalam, Saleh Lafi Alanezi, Yazeed Abdulaziz Alsulaiman, Mohammad Irshad, Shaffi Ahmed Shaik, Nehal Khamis&lt;/p&gt;

When some individuals are screen-detected before the beginning of the study, but otherwise would have been diagnosed symptomatically during the study, this results in different case-ascertainment probabilities among screened and unscreened participants, referred to here as lead-time-biased case-ascertainment (LTBCA). In fact, this issue can arise even in risk-factor studies nested within a randomized screening trial; even though the screening intervention is randomly allocated to trial arms, there is no randomization to potential risk-factors and uptake of screening can differ by risk-factor strata. Under the assumptions that neither screening nor the risk factor affects underlying incidence and no other forms of bias operate, we simulate and compare the underlying cumulative incidence and that observed in the study due to LTBCA. The example used will be constructed from the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial. The derived mathematical model is applied to simulating two nested studies to evaluate the potential for screening bias in observational lung cancer studies. Because of differential screening under plausible assumptions about preclinical incidence and duration, the simulations presented here show that LTBCA due to chest x-ray screening can significantly increase the estimated risk of lung cancer due to smoking by 1% and 50%. Traditional adjustment methods cannot account for this bias, as the influence screening has on observational study estimates involves events outside of the study observation window (enrollment and follow-up) that change eligibility for potential participants, thus biasing case ascertainment.</content></content><author><name>Rick J.

Riparian zones are very rich in species but subjected to strong anthropogenic changes and extremely prone to alien plant invasions, which are considered to be a serious threat to biodiversity. Our aim was to determine the spatial distribution of &lt;i&gt;Chenopodium ficifolium&lt;/i&gt;, a species demonstrating strong confinement to large river valleys in Central Europe and an indicator of annual pioneer nitrophilous vegetation developing on river banks, which are considered to be of importance to the European Community. Additionally, the habitat preferences of the species were analysed. Differences in the richness and abundance of species diagnostic for riverside habitats, as well as the contribution of resident and invasive alien species in vegetation plots along three rivers differing in terms of size and anthropogenic impact were also examined. Finally, the effect of invaders on the phytocoenoses typical for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ficifolium&lt;/i&gt; was assessed. The frequency of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ficifolium&lt;/i&gt; clearly decreased with an increasing distance from the river. Among natural habitats, the species mostly preferred the banks of large rivers. The vegetation plots developing on the banks of the three studied rivers differed in total species richness, the number and cover of resident, diagnostic and invasive alien species, as well as in species composition.

Both stem cell therapy and physical treatments have been shown to be beneficial in accelerating bone healing. However, the efficacy of combined treatment with stem cells and physical stimuli for large bone defects remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone regeneration effects of low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) and human adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) treatments during fracture repair using a comparative rat calvarial defect model. We evaluated the viability of human ADSCs, which were cultured on a porous PLGA scaffold using an MTS assay. The critical-sized calvarial bone defect rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPLI group, ADSC group, and ADSC+LPLI group. Bone formation was evaluated using micro-CT. New bone formation areas and osteogenic factor expression levels were then examined by histomorphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Our data showed that PLGA had no cytotoxic effect on human ADSCs. Micro-CT analyses revealed that both the LPLI and ADSC groups showed improved calvarial bone defect healing compared to the control group. In addition, the ADSC+LPLI group showed significantly increased bone volume at 16 weeks after surgery. The area of new bone formation ranked as follows: control group &amp;lt; LPLI group &amp;lt; ADSC group &amp;lt; ADSC+LPLI group. There were significant differences between the groups. In addition, both ADSC and ADSC+LPLI groups showed strong signals of vWF expression. ADSC and LPLI treatments improved fracture repair in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats.

Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that this auxiliary recognition element facilitates the recruitment of dual-phosphorylated substrates containing a pTxpY motif.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Attacking olefins with chiral acids</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-b?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c80:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1480.2.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-b?rss=1</originId><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><fingerprint>7def6a49</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><published>1522345097000</published></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Integrated analysis of transcriptome and proteome changes related to the Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility in cabbage</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193462</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1621b4b57ed:64b3a6a:7c9981b6</id><updated>1520888400000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193462</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193462</originId><published>1520888400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>44d66f7b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193462</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miaomiao Xing, Chao Sun, Hailong Li, Shilin Hu, Lei Lei, Jungen Kang&lt;/p&gt;
Cabbage (&lt;i&gt;Brassica oleracea&lt;/i&gt; L. var. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt;), an important vegetable crop in the Brassicaceae family, is economically important worldwide. In the process of hybrid seed production, Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (OguCMS), controlled by the mitochondrial gene &lt;i&gt;orf138&lt;/i&gt;, has been extensively used for cabbage hybrid production with complete and stable male sterility. To identify the critical genes and pathways involved in the sterility and to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, the anther of OguCMS line R2P2CMS and the fertile line R2P2 were used for RNA-seq and iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) proteome analysis. RNA-seq analysis generated 13,037,109 to 13,066,594 SE50-clean reads, from the sterile and fertile lines, which were assembled into 36,890 unigenes. Among them, 1,323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, consisting of 307 up- and 1016 down-regulated genes. For ITRAQ analysis, a total of 7,147 unique proteins were identified, and 833 were differentially expressed including 538 up- and 295 down-regulated proteins. These were mainly annotated to the ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA surveillance pathways. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified 22 and 70 genes with the same and opposite expression profiles, respectively. Using KEGG analysis of DEGs, gibberellin mediated signaling pathways regulating tapetum programmed cell death and four different pathways involved in sporopollenin synthesis were identified. Secretion and translocation of the sporopollenin precursors were identified, and the key genes participating in these pathways were all significantly down-regulated in R2P2CMS. Light and transmission electron (TE) microscopy revealed fat abnormal tapetum rather than vacuolization and degradation at the tetrad and microspore stages of the OguCMS line. This resulted in the failed deposition of sporopollenin on the pollen resulting in sterility. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism underlying OguCMS in cabbage.</content></content><author><name>Miaomiao Xing</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miaomiao Xing, Chao Sun, Hailong Li, Shilin Hu, Lei Lei, Jungen Kang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (ASSNAC) was shown in our previous study to activate Nrf2-mediated processes and increase glutathione level and resistance to oxidative stress in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we explored the antioxidant protective effect of ASSNAC in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans)&lt;/i&gt;. Treatment of &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours). In addition, ASSNAC (2 mM; 24 hours) treatment of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; strains N2 (wild type strain), &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter (CL2166) and temperature sensitive sterile strain (CF512) significantly increased GST enzyme activity by 1.9-, 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively. ASSNAC (2.0 mM; 24 hours) increased the reduced glutathione content in N2 and CF512 strains by 5.9- and 4.9-fold, respectively. Exposure of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; (N2 strain) to a lethal concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.5 mM; 120 min) resulted in death of 88% of the nematodes while pretreatment with ASSNAC (24 hours) reduced nematodes death in a concentration-dependent manner down to 8% at 2.0 mM. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes (strain CF512) cultured on agar plates containing ASSNAC (0.5 to 5.0 mM) demonstrated a significant increase in lifespan compared to control (mean lifespan 26.45 ± 0.64 versus 22.90 ± 0.59 days; log-rank p ≤ 0.001 at 2.0 mM) with a maximal lifespan of 40 versus 36 days. In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan.</content></content><author><name>Naphtali Savion</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naphtali Savion, Amir Levine, Shlomo Kotev-Emeth, Ulrike Bening Abu-Shach, Limor Broday&lt;/p&gt;

Identifying effective antivirals for treating Ebola virus disease (EVD) and minimizing transmission of such disease is critical. A variety of cell-based assays have been developed for evaluating compounds for activity against Ebola virus. However, very few reports discuss the variable assay conditions that can affect the results obtained from these drug screens. Here, we describe variable conditions tested during the development of our cell-based drug screen assays designed to identify compounds with anti-Ebola virus activity using established cell lines and human primary cells. The effect of multiple assay readouts and variable assay conditions, including virus input, time of infection, and the cell passage number, were compared, and the impact on the effective concentration for 50% and/ or 90% inhibition (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, EC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;) was evaluated using the FDA-approved compound, toremifene citrate. In these studies, we show that altering cell-based assay conditions can have an impact on apparent drug potency as measured by the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. These results further support the importance of developing standard operating procedures for generating reliable and reproducible &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data sets for potential antivirals.</content></content><author><name>Elena Postnikova</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elena Postnikova, Yu Cong, Lisa Evans DeWald, Julie Dyall, Shuiqing Yu, Brit J.

Microbiome science is revealing that the phenotype and health of animals, including humans, depend on the sustained function of their resident microorganisms. In this essay, I argue for thoughtful choice of model systems for human microbiome science. A greater variety of experimental systems, including wider use of invertebrate models, would benefit biomedical research, while systems ill-suited to experimental and genetic manipulation can be used to address very limited sets of scientific questions. Microbiome science benefits from the coordinated use of multiple systems, which is facilitated by networks of researchers with expertise in different experimental systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hcSqNJvl82E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Angela E.

This demonstrates that epigenetically derailed tumor conditions can be reversed when targeting key players in the transcriptional network.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>A zipped-helix cap potentiates HAMP domain control of chemoreceptor signaling [Microbiology]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3519.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162b12a08af:1e3d5:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/15.cover-source.jpg?itok=EV6OyZPq</url><width>359</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>480</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3519</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3519.short?rss=1</originId><published>1523386901000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5325958</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3519.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Environmental awareness is an essential attribute for all organisms.

Background &lt;p&gt;The status of tuberculosis (TB) patients since initiation of treatment is unknown in South Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes of smear-positive TB patients since initiation and completion of treatment, which includes TB recurrence and mortality of TB patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We did a retrospective cohort study on 2,272 smear-positive TB patients who initiated treatment for TB from September 1, 2002—October 10, 2012 in health facilities in Dale district and Yirgalem town administration. We followed them from the date of start of treatment to either the date of interview or date of death.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Recurrence rate of TB was 15.2 per 1000 person-years. Recurrence was higher for re-treatment cases (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4–5.3). Mortality rate of TB patients was 27.1 per 1,000 person-years. The risk was high for patients above 34 years of age (aHR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2–3.9), poor patients (aHR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.8), patients with poor treatment outcomes (aHR, 6.7; 95% CI, 5.1–8.9) and for patients treated at least 3 times (aHR 4.8; 95% CI, 2.1–11.1).

To unveil novel global changes associated with corpus luteum (CL) maturation, we analyzed transcriptome data for the bovine CL on days 4 and 11, representing the developing vs. mature gland. Our analyses revealed 681 differentially expressed genes (363 and 318 on day 4 and 11, respectively), with ≥2 fold change and FDR of &amp;lt;5%. Different gene ontology (GO) categories were represented prominently in transcriptome data at these stages (e.g. days 4: cell cycle, chromosome, DNA metabolic process and replication and on day 11: immune response; lipid metabolic process and complement activation). Based on bioinformatic analyses, select genes expression in day 4 and 11 CL was validated with quantitative real-time PCR. Cell specific expression was also determined in enriched luteal endothelial and steroidogenic cells. Genes related to the angiogenic process such as &lt;i&gt;NOS3&lt;/i&gt;, which maintains dilated vessels and &lt;i&gt;MMP9&lt;/i&gt;, matrix degrading enzyme, were higher on day 4. Importantly, our data suggests day 11 CL acquire mechanisms to prevent blood vessel sprouting and promote their maturation by expressing &lt;i&gt;NOTCH4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;JAG1&lt;/i&gt;, greatly enriched in luteal endothelial cells. Another endothelial specific gene, &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt;, was identified here in the CL for the first time. &lt;i&gt;CD300LG&lt;/i&gt; is an adhesion molecule enabling lymphocyte migration, its higher levels at mid cycle are expected to support the transmigration of immune cells into the CL at this stage. Together with steroidogenic genes, most of the genes regulating de-novo cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (e.g &lt;i&gt;HMGCS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HMGCR&lt;/i&gt;) and cholesterol uptake from plasma (&lt;i&gt;LDLR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) were upregulated in the mature CL.

Avian Colibacillosis is among the major causes of economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide, with a more vivid impact on developing countries. The involvement of several bacteria has made it challenging to develop effective vaccines for this disease, particularly because it is notoriously difficult to make a vaccine that contains all the contributing pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report the design and fabrication of a bacterial ghost (BG) of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80, which is among the major bacterial serotypes responsible for this disease. The generated ghost is then exploited as a homologous vaccine against Avian Colibacillosis. We demonstrate that hole formation in the cell wall of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O78:K80 can happen properly in optical densities as high as 0.8 compared to the 0.3–0.4 standard for bacteria like &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10. This is especially advantageous for mass production of this ghost which is a vital factor in development of any BG-based vaccine. Compared to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10, we faced a great challenge in transforming the wild type bacteria with the E-lysis plasmid which was probably due to higher thickness of the cell wall in O78:K80. This, however, was addressed by treating the cell wall with a different combination of ions.The vaccine was administered to Ross 308 broiler chickens via injection as well as through their respiratory system at a dose of 1010 BGs, repeated 3 times at weekly intervals. Chickens were then challenged with the wild type O78:K80 at a dose of 1011 bacteria together with Infectious Bronchitis H120 vaccine (as immunosuppressant) one week after the last immunization. Air sac lesions were significantly reduced in BG vaccinated groups in comparison with the control group. The levels of IFN&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, IgA and IgY were measured in the serum of immunized chickens as an indication of immune response and were compared with those of the chickens vaccinated with killed bacteria. The results show that O78:K80 BG can be used as an efficient homologous vaccine against Colibacillosis disease in poultry. We expect our findings can serve as the starting point for designing more sophisticated vaccines that contain all three major pathogenic bacteria involved in avian Colibacillosis.</content></content><author><name>Hakimeh Ebrahimi-Nik</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hakimeh Ebrahimi-Nik, Mohammad Reza Bassami, Mehrdad Mohri, Mehrnaz Rad, Mazhar I.

Births outside marriage (BoM) account for around 15% of all births globally. However, the distribution around the world is very uneven, as are cultural and political attitudes towards them. Studies from East Asia have shown that the percentage of such births is very low, with only modest increases in recent years. The orthodox demographic view holds that the maintenance of conservative views around the relationship between marriage and childbearing can play a role in keeping fertility low. Prenuptial pregnancies (PNP) (where births occur within eight months of marriage) have been identified as a growing phenomenon in Japan, possibly being an ‘alternative’ Asian pathway to family formation. As yet, no comprehensive statistical analysis of the trends of BoM or PNP has been performed for Hong Kong. Using a comprehensive microdata set of birth registration in Hong Kong from 1984–2015 (N = 1,680,831) we provide evidence of recent trends in such ‘alternative pathways’ to family formation and examine predictors through regression analysis. Our results indicate, in common with elsewhere in East Asia, low overall period rates of either BoM or PNP (although the latter has risen notably in recent years). While more recent birth cohorts exhibit higher prevalence of such births, their incomplete nature and higher expected propensity suggests that the figures are exaggerated. In our regression analysis, we find that lower educational attainment is a strong predictor of both BoM and PNP, suggesting that a bifurcation of experience may be occurring. This adds further evidence to the theory that the maintenance of traditional family formation systems in the context of revolutionised educational and work opportunities for women mean that the opportunity costs of the ‘marriage package’ become too high.

The waste of commonly used medicines is known to contaminate freshwater ecosystems. Pharmaceuticals can be toxic, mutagenic, or modifying to freshwater organisms even at low concentrations if consider their permanent presence in the environment. Chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer, and in particular alkylating agents, contribute significantly to this form of pollution, the latter introducing cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to the DNA and RNA of organisms which can be disruptive to their cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide (CP) on &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt; clones. We evaluated the life history parameters and protein profiles of this crustacean following exposure to environmentally relevant CP concentration of 10 ng L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Even at this low concentration, the alkylating agent caused modification of the life history parameters and proteome profile of the &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt;. These changes were clone-specific and involved growth rate, age at first reproduction, neonate number, and proteins related to cell cycle and redox state regulation. The disturbance caused by pharmaceuticals contaminating freshwater ecosystem is probably weaker and unlikely to be cytotoxic in character due to the high dilution of these substances in the water. However, our results indicate that prolonged exposure of organisms to these toxins may lead to modifications on the organismal and molecular levels with unpredictable significance for the entire ecosystem.</content></content><author><name>Małgorzata Grzesiuk</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;

The importance of patch quality for amphibians is frequently overlooked in distribution models. Here we demonstrate that it is highly important for the persistence of endemic and endangered amphibians found in the threatened and fragile ecosystems that are the rocky plateaus in Western Maharashtra, India. These plateaus are ferricretes of laterite and characterise the northern section of the Western Ghats/Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, the eighth most important global hotspot and one of the three most threatened by population growth. We present statistically supported habitat associations for endangered and data-deficient Indian amphibians, demonstrating significant relationships between individual species and their microhabitats. Data were collected during early monsoon across two seasons. Twenty-one amphibian taxa were identified from 14 lateritic plateaus between 67 and 1179m above sea level. Twelve of the study taxa had significant associations with microhabitats using a stepwise analysis of the AICc subroutine (distLM, Primer-e, v7).

The importance of patch quality for amphibians is frequently overlooked in distribution models. Here we demonstrate that it is highly important for the persistence of endemic and endangered amphibians found in the threatened and fragile ecosystems that are the rocky plateaus in Western Maharashtra, India. These plateaus are ferricretes of laterite and characterise the northern section of the Western Ghats/Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, the eighth most important global hotspot and one of the three most threatened by population growth. We present statistically supported habitat associations for endangered and data-deficient Indian amphibians, demonstrating significant relationships between individual species and their microhabitats. Data were collected during early monsoon across two seasons. Twenty-one amphibian taxa were identified from 14 lateritic plateaus between 67 and 1179m above sea level. Twelve of the study taxa had significant associations with microhabitats using a stepwise analysis of the AICc subroutine (distLM, Primer-e, v7). Generalist taxa were associated with increased numbers of microhabitat types. Non-significant associations are reported for the remaining 9 taxa. Microhabitat distribution was spatially structured and driven by climate and human activity. Woody plants were associated with 44% of high-elevation taxa. Of the 8 low-elevation taxa 63% related to water bodies and 60% of those were associated with pools. Rock size and abundance were important for 33% of high elevation specialists. Three of the 4 caecilians were associated with rocks in addition to soil and stream presence. We conclude the plateaus are individualistic patches whose habitat quality is defined by their microhabitats within climatic zones.</description></item><item><engagement>42</engagement><title>Gut microbes are vulnerable to wide range of drugs</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02780-x</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1623f50aafa:27f2f24:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-02780-x/d41586-018-02780-x_15536840.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02780-x</originId><published>1521442800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fb5ba307</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02780-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gut microbes are vulnerable to wide range of drugs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut microbes are vulnerable to wide range of drugs, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02780-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02780-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Antibiotics are not alone in harming intestinal flora.</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1521480674042</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gut microbes are vulnerable to wide range of drugs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut microbes are vulnerable to wide range of drugs, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02780-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02780-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Antibiotics are not alone in harming intestinal flora.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01593</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Marbostat-100 Defines a New Class of Potent and Selective Antiinflammatory and Antirheumatic Histone Deacetylase 6 Inhibitors</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01593</link><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_1629c9d3f19:566aff:51a16d64</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01593/20180406/images/medium/jm-2017-01593c_0015.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>222</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01593</originId><crawled>1523045973785</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId></origin><fingerprint>81d4c296</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01593/20180406/images/medium/jm-2017-01593c_0015.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01593&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Delivery of recombinant proteins to therapeutic cells is limited by a lack of efficient methods. This hinders the use of transcription factors or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) ribonucleoproteins to develop cell therapies. Here, we report a soluble peptide designed for the direct delivery of proteins to mammalian cells including human stem cells, hard-to-modify primary natural killer (NK) cells, and cancer cell models. This peptide is composed of a 6x histidine-rich domain fused to the endosomolytic peptide CM18 and the cell penetrating peptide PTD4. A less than two-minute co-incubation of 6His-CM18-PTD4 peptide with spCas9 and/or asCpf1 CRISPR ribonucleoproteins achieves robust gene editing. The same procedure, co-incubating with the transcription factor HoxB4, achieves transcriptional regulation. The broad applicability and flexibility of this DNA- and chemical-free method across different cell types, particularly hard-to-transfect cells, opens the way for a direct use of proteins for biomedical research and cell therapy manufacturing.</content></content><author><name>Thomas Del’Guidice</name></author><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Del’Guidice, Jean-Pascal Lepetit-Stoffaes, Louis-Jean Bordeleau, Joannie Roberge, Vanessa Théberge, Coraline Lauvaux, Xavier Barbeau, Jessica Trottier, Vibhuti Dave, Denis-Claude Roy, Bruno Gaillet, Alain Garnier, David Guay&lt;/p&gt;

Damaged cartilage has very low regenerative potential which has led to the search for novel tissue-engineering approaches to help treat cartilage defects. While various approaches have been reported, there is no perfect treatment currently. In this study we evaluated the effects of a plant extract, chlorogenic acid (CGA), as part of chondrocyte transplantation on a model of knee joint injury in chicks. First, primary cultured chondrocytes used to evaluate the effects of CGA on chondrogenesis. Then using an articular cartilage injury model of chick knee we assessed the functional recovery after transplantation of the complexes containing chondrocytes and CGA in an alginate scaffold. Histological analysis, PCR, and western blot were further used to understand the underlying mechanisms. We showed that 60 μM CGA in alginate exhibited notable effects on stimulating chondrogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Secondly, it was shown that the application of these complexes accelerated the recovery of injury-induced dysfunction by gait analysis when followed for 21 days. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that there was less abnormal vasculature formation, more chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage matrix synthesis in the presence of the complexes containing CGA. We discovered CGA treated transplantation up-regulated the expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 which were responsible for the stimulation of chondrogenesis. Furthermore, the application of these complexes could suppress the abnormal angiogenesis and fibrosis at the injury site. Lastly, the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, p-p65, and MMPs expression were decreased in the presence of CGA. This may be caused through adjusting cellular redox homeostasis associated with Nrf2. This study suggests that combining chondrocytes and CGA on an alginate scaffold can improve the recovery of damaged articular cartilage.</content></content><author><name>Xin Cheng</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xin Cheng, Ke Li, Shengsong Xu, Peizhi Li, Yu Yan, Guang Wang, Zachary Berman, Rui Guo, Jianxin Liang, Sira Traore, Xuesong Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Phycobilisomes (PBS) are accessory light harvesting protein complexes formed mainly by phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The PBPs absorb light that is efficiently transferred to Photosystems due to chromophores covalently bound to specific cysteine residues. Besides phycobiliproteins (PE), the PBS contains linker proteins responsible for assembly and stabilization of the whole complex and the tuning of energy transfer steps between chromophores. The linker (γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;) from &lt;i&gt;Gracilaria chilensis&lt;/i&gt;, is a chromophorylated rod linker associated to (αβ)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; hexamers of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE). Its role in the energy transfer process is not clear yet. Structural studies as well as the composition and location of the chromophores are essential to understand their involvement in the energy transfer process in PBS. To achieve this, the coding gene of γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was analyzed by informatics tools, to obtain preliminary information which leaded the next experiments. The protein was purified from R-phycoerythrin, and the sequence confirmed by mass spectrometry. The coding sequence analysis revealed a protein of 318 aminoacid residues containing a chloroplastidial transit peptide (cTP) of 39 aminoacids at the N-terminus. The conservation of cysteines revealed possible chromophorylation sites. Using α and β R-PE subunits as spectroscopic probes in denaturation assays, we deduced a double bonded phycourobilin (PUB) on γ&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; subunit that were confirmed between Cys62 and Cys73 (DL-PUB&lt;sup&gt;62/73&lt;/sup&gt;) by mass spectrometry.

The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) software reconstructs dynamic regulatory networks by integrating static protein-DNA interaction data with time series gene expression data. In recent years, several additional types of high-throughput time series data have been profiled when studying biological processes including time series miRNA expression, proteomics, epigenomics and single cell RNA-Seq. Combining all available time series and static datasets in a unified model remains an important challenge and goal. To address this challenge we have developed a new version of DREM termed interactive DREM (iDREM). iDREM provides support for all data types mentioned above and combines them with existing interaction data to reconstruct networks that can lead to novel hypotheses on the function and timing of regulators. Users can interactively visualize and query the resulting model. We showcase the functionality of the new tool by applying it to microglia developmental data from multiple labs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/73xX3n_LGQE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jun Ding</name></author><crawled>1521049722567</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jun Ding, James S.

Rapid repair of vascular injury is an important prognostic factor for electrical burns. This repair is achieved mainly via stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α promoting the mobilization, chemotaxis, homing, and targeted differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into endothelial cells.

Rapid repair of vascular injury is an important prognostic factor for electrical burns. This repair is achieved mainly via stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α promoting the mobilization, chemotaxis, homing, and targeted differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into endothelial cells. Forming a concentration gradient from the site of local damage in the circulation is essential to the role of SDF-1α. In a previous study, we developed reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive PPADT nanoparticles containing SDF-1α that could degrade in response to high concentration of ROS in tissue lesions, achieving the goal of targeted SDF-1α release. In the current study, a rat vascular injury model of electrical burns was used to evaluate the effects of targeted release of SDF-1α using PPADT nanoparticles on the chemotaxis of BMSCs and the repair of vascular injury. Continuous exposure to 220 V for 6 s could damage rat vascular endothelial cells, strip off the inner layer, significantly elevate the local level of ROS, and decrease the level of SDF-1α. After injection of Cy5-labeled SDF-1α-PPADT nanoparticles, the distribution of Cy5 fluorescence suggested that SDF-1α was distributed primarily at the injury site, and the local SDF-1α levels increased significantly.

In this paper, explicit Model Predictive Control(MPC) is employed for automated lane-keeping systems. MPC has been regarded as the key to handle such constrained systems. However, the massive computational complexity of MPC, which employs online optimization, has been a major drawback that limits the range of its target application to relatively small and/or slow problems. Explicit MPC can reduce this computational burden using a multi-parametric quadratic programming technique(mp-QP). The control objective is to derive an optimal front steering wheel angle at each sampling time so that autonomous vehicles travel along desired paths, including straight, circular, and clothoid parts, at high entry speeds. In terms of the design of the proposed controller, a method of choosing weighting matrices in an optimization problem and the range of horizons for path-following control are described through simulations.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the retention and discontinuation reasons of seven biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) in a real-world setting of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 1,037 treatment courses with bDMARDs from 2009 to 2016 [female, 81.8%; baseline age, 59.6 y; disease duration 7.8 y; rheumatoid factor positivity 81.5%; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), 4.4; concomitant prednisolone 43.5% and methotrexate 68.6%; Bio-naïve, 57.1%; abatacept (ABT), 21.3%; tocilizumab (TCZ), 20.7%; golimumab (GLM), 16.9%; etanercept (ETN), 13.6%; adalimumab (ADA), 11.1%; infliximab (IFX), 8.5%; certolizumab pegol (CZP), 7.9%] were included in this multi-center, retrospective study. Drug retention and discontinuation reasons at 36 months were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and adjusted by potent confounders using Cox proportional hazards modeling. As a result, 455 treatment courses (43.9%) were stopped, with 217 (20.9%) stopping due to inefficacy, 113 (10.9%) due to non-toxic reasons, 86 (8.3%) due to toxic adverse events, and 39 (3.8%) due to remission. Drug retention rates in the adjusted model were as follows: total retention (ABT, 60.7%; ADA, 32.7%; CZP, 43.3%; ETN, 51.9%; GLM, 45.4%; IFX, 31.1%; and TCZ, 59.2%; P &amp;lt; 0.001); inefficacy (ABT, 81.4%; ADA, 65.7%; CZP, 60.7%; ETN, 71.3%; GLM, 68.5%; IFX, 65.0%; and TCZ, 81.4%; P = 0.015), toxic adverse events (ABT, 89.8%; ADA, 80.5%; CZP, 83.9%; ETN, 89.2%; GLM, 85.5%; IFX, 75.6%; and TCZ, 77.2%; P = 0.50), and remission (ABT, 95.5%; ADA, 88.1%; CZP, 91.1%; ETN, 97.5%; GLM, 94.7%; IFX, 86.4%; and TCZ, 98.4%; P &amp;lt; 0.001).

The growing area of European hazelnut (&lt;i&gt;Corylus avellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is increasing, as well as the number of producing countries, and there is a pressing need for new improved cultivars. Hazelnut conventional breeding process is slow, due to the length of juvenile phase and the high heterozygosity level. The development of genetic linkage maps and the identification of molecular markers tightly linked to QTL (quantitative trait loci) of agronomic interest are essential tools for speeding up the selection of seedlings carrying desired traits through marker-assisted selection. The objectives of this study were to enrich a previous linkage map and confirm QTL related to time of leaf budburst, using an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; population obtained by crossing Tonda Gentile delle Langhe with Merveille de Bollwiller. Genotyping-by-Sequencing was used to identify a total of 9,999 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Well saturated linkage maps were constructed for each parent using the double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. A reciprocal translocation was detected in Tonda Gentile delle Langhe between two non-homologous chromosomes. Applying a bioinformatic approach, we were able to disentangle ‘pseudo-linkage’ between markers, removing markers around the translocation breakpoints and obtain a linear order of the markers for the two chromosomes arms, for each linkage group involved in the translocation. Twenty-nine QTL for time of leaf budburst were identified, including a stably expressed region on LG_02 of the Tonda Gentile delle Langhe map. The stability of these QTL and their coding sequence content indicates promise for the identification of specific chromosomal regions carrying key genes involved in leaf budburst.</content></content><author><name>Daniela Torello Marinoni</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Torello Marinoni, Nadia Valentini, Ezio Portis, Alberto Acquadro, Chiara Beltramo, Shawn A.

Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research.

Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt; published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Leveraging chromatin accessibility for transcriptional regulatory network inference in T Helper 17 Cells [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292987v2?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162970d0672:a3ddd66:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/05/292987</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292987v2?rss=1</originId><published>1522911600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2aaa40c7</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292987v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) provide insight into cellular behavior by describing interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their gene targets.
