We show that implantation of autologous tooth stem cells from deciduous teeth regenerated dental pulp with an odontoblast layer, blood vessels, and nerves in two animal models. These results prompted us to enroll 40 patients with pulp necrosis after traumatic dental injuries in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. We randomly allocated 30 patients to the human deciduous pulp stem cell (hDPSC) implantation group and 10 patients to the group receiving traditional apexification treatment. Four patients were excluded from the implantation group due to loss at follow-up (three patients) and retrauma of the treated tooth (one patient). We examined 26 patients (26 teeth) after hDPSC implantation and 10 patients (10 teeth) after apexification treatment. hDPSC implantation, but not apexification treatment, led to regeneration of three-dimensional pulp tissue equipped with blood vessels and sensory nerves at 12 months after treatment. hDPSC implantation increased the length of the root (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and reduced the width of the apical foramen (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) compared to the apexification group. In addition, hDPSC implantation led to regeneration of dental pulp tissue containing sensory nerves. To evaluate the safety of hDPSC implantation, we followed 20 patients implanted with hDPSCs for 24 months and did not observe any adverse events.

The findings of this investigation recognize the detrimental nsSNPs which enhance the danger of various kinds of oncogenesis in patients of different populations in genome-wide studies (GWS).</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/04/408476</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05826-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1534921200000</published><entities><item><mentions><item><text>ZIKV</text></item><item><text>Zika</text></item></mentions><label>Zika virus</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Zika virus</id></item><item><mentions><item><text>dpi</text></item><item><text>DPI</text></item></mentions><label>dpi</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/dpi</id></item><item><mentions><item><text>West Nile</text></item><item><text>WNV</text></item></mentions><label>West Nile virus</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/West Nile virus</id></item><item><mentions><item><text>PLN</text></item></mentions><label>PLN</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/pln</id></item><item><mentions><item><text>RT</text></item></mentions><label>RT</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/RT (TV network)</id></item></entities><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05826-w</originId><crawled>1534929992164</crawled><visual><height>394</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-05826-w/MediaObjects/41467_2018_5826_Fig1_HTML.png</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/png</contentType></visual><fingerprint>76a589e5</fingerprint><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16560f4f9e4:95f0afb:6f86c10b</id><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/pkmyBLgJFYw/s41467-018-05826-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Megan A.

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that you think about is resolution. The closer you can pin down the location of every single atom around the binding site, the better the shape you’re in for SBDD. As it stands right now, according to the authors, there are 672 structures in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/&quot;&gt;EMDB&lt;/a&gt; archives at 4Å resolution or better. But only 75 of those are better than 3Å, and only 12 are at 2.5Å or better. And there are only five structures below 3Å with small molecule ligands in them, so there’s the state of the art. Here they are: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01664-4&quot;&gt;paromomycin with&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Leishmania&lt;/em&gt; ribosome, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416305918&quot;&gt;GSK2837808A with&lt;/a&gt; lactate dehydrogenase B, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17964&quot;&gt;resiniferatoxin with TRPV1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6275/871&quot;&gt;UPCDC30245 with&lt;/a&gt; p97, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6239/1147&quot;&gt;PETG with&lt;/a&gt; beta-galactosidase. And there’s only one paper (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201731&quot;&gt;mefloquine with&lt;/a&gt; the Plasmodium 80S ribosome, from last year) that shows use of cryo-EM structural data to propose and test new compounds, although you’d have to think that this is happening industrially, outside the current range of open publication. But by any standards, it’s early. Very early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper identifies some bottlenecks that are going to have to be widened for this technique to become a regular part of the process. Sample preparation and data collection are the first. As it is now, cryo-EM is largely a handcrafted art form, especially at the high-resolution end of things. In particular, my impression is that collecting data to get down to below 3Å resolution can really send you out on the long tail as you fill in gaps in the data set. Significant automation needs to be brought in for higher throughput (people are actively working on this), and there need to be improvements in both the processes and the hardware in order to increase the success rates at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get past that, the next barrier is working up all those data points. As it stands, say the authors, the best software (while semi-automated) is far from being able to generate structures without significant human oversight and intervention. It’s another art form at this point, and it needs experienced people with good judgment at the controls. The progress of instrumentation, though, has always been to make such people less valuable and necessary for any given machine, which seems a bit perverse until you consider what short supply they’re in. Work is underway in this area as well, to try to make things as robust as X-ray data processing has become, but it’s not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also emphasize a key point: making the whole process faster is not only useful, it’s essential if cryo-EM is to have the maximum impact in a drug discovery organization. There are many, many techniques out there that started out being able to provide interesting and useful information, but too slowly to have any effect on actual drug projects. Some of them picked up speed and are now able to catch the bus (as it takes off in a cloud of dust), and others haven’t, or not yet. But projects move right along (or should), and if you’re always running behind the crowd, yelling “Hold on, guys! I think I found something else!” you’re not going to be as effective as you could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, rapid progress is expected. The experience of X-ray crystallography helps a great deal: we know what high-thoughput systems look like in that (related) field, so we know what to aim for and what the differences and weak points probably are. And the demand for this technique is huge: a really robust cryo-EM setup would be a huge help in drug discovery and would illuminate binding events for targets that are almost complete black boxes as things stand now. Structure-based methods are not the instant answer to all your problems, of course, but they’re still pretty damned useful, especially for the kinds of proteins that cryo-EM can target. So speed the day. Revisiting this topic in a couple of years should show some real advances.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><description>OK, all this cryo-electron microscopy stuff is great, new protein structures, things that are huge, that can’t be crystallized, fine, fine: but when, the medicinal chemists in the audience ask, will we be able to use it for structure-based drug discovery?

Herein, we report on the use of partially miscible binary liquid mixtures that lend their microfluidic properties from a highly temperature-sensitive mixing and phase separation behaviour. For a blend composed of the thermotropic liquid crystal 4-Cyano-4&apos;-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) and methanol, mixing at temperatures above the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) leads to a uniform single phase while partial mixing can be achieved at temperatures below the UCST. Thermally-driven phase separation inside the microfluidic channels results in the formation of very regular phase arrangements, namely in droplets, plug, slug and annular flow. We map different flow regimes and relate findings to the role of viscous, interfacial and inertial forces. As the interfacial tension of the mixture and the dynamic viscosity of the separated phases are inversely proportional to temperature, different flow regimes can be achieved at constant channel architecture and flow rate. A consistent behaviour is observed for a binary liquid mixture with lower critical solution temperature, namely 2,6-lutidine and water. This temperature-responsive approach to microfluidics is an interesting candidate for multi-stage processes, selective extraction and sensing applications.</content></summary><description>Two-phase liquid-liquid microfluidics relies on the intricate control over the fluid properties of liquid mixtures. Herein, we report on the use of partially miscible binary liquid mixtures that lend their microfluidic properties from a highly temperature-sensitive mixing and phase separation behaviour. For a blend composed of the thermotropic liquid crystal 4-Cyano-4&apos;-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) and methanol, mixing at temperatures above the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) leads to a uniform single phase while partial mixing can be achieved at temperatures below the UCST. Thermally-driven phase separation inside the microfluidic channels results in the formation of very regular phase arrangements, namely in droplets, plug, slug and annular flow. We map different flow regimes and relate findings to the role of viscous, interfacial and inertial forces. As the interfacial tension of the mixture and the dynamic viscosity of the separated phases are inversely proportional to temperature, different flow regimes can be achieved at constant channel architecture and flow rate. A consistent behaviour is observed for a binary liquid mixture with lower critical solution temperature, namely 2,6-lutidine and water. This temperature-responsive approach to microfluidics is an interesting candidate for multi-stage processes, selective extraction and sensing applications.</description><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1535526000000</published><entities><item><mentions><item><text>CERN</text></item></mentions><label>CERN</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/CERN</id></item><item><mentions><item><text>Large Hadron Collider</text></item><item><text>LHC</text></item></mentions><label>Large Hadron Collider</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Large Hadron Collider</id></item></entities><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06114-9</originId><crawled>1535566975942</crawled><visual><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06114-9/d41586-018-06114-9_16081576.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><fingerprint>9ca86368</fingerprint><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16586ec93c6:5c85ba:4c71e4fe</id><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06114-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>17</engagement><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds><author><name>Davide Castelvecchi</name></author><title>CERN’s pioneering mini-accelerator passes first test</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06114-9</link><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CERN’s pioneering mini-accelerator passes first test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CERN’s pioneering mini-accelerator passes first test, Published online: 29 August 2018;

Our biological and robophysical excavation experiments, supported by computational and theoretical models, reveal that digging performance can be robustly optimized within the constraints of narrow tunnels by individual idleness and retreating.

Our biological and robophysical excavation experiments, supported by computational and theoretical models, reveal that digging performance can be robustly optimized within the constraints of narrow tunnels by individual idleness and retreating.

Hi-C is a powerful genome-wide technique to measure the contact count of pairs of genomic loci needed to study three-dimensional organization. Due to experimental costs high resolution Hi-C datasets are avail- able only for a handful of cell lines. Computational prediction of Hi-C contact counts can offer a scalable and inexpensive approach to examine three-dimensional genome organization across many cellular contexts. Here we present HiC-Reg, a novel approach to predict contact counts from one-dimensional regulatory signals such as epigenetic marks and regulatory protein binding. HiC-Reg exploits the signal from the region spanning two interacting regions and from across multiple cell lines to generalize to new contexts.

Hi-C is a powerful genome-wide technique to measure the contact count of pairs of genomic loci needed to study three-dimensional organization. Due to experimental costs high resolution Hi-C datasets are avail- able only for a handful of cell lines. Computational prediction of Hi-C contact counts can offer a scalable and inexpensive approach to examine three-dimensional genome organization across many cellular contexts. Here we present HiC-Reg, a novel approach to predict contact counts from one-dimensional regulatory signals such as epigenetic marks and regulatory protein binding. HiC-Reg exploits the signal from the region spanning two interacting regions and from across multiple cell lines to generalize to new contexts. Using existing feature importance measures and a new matrix factorization based approach, we found CTCF and chromatin marks, especially repressive and elongation marks, as important for predictive performance. Predicted counts from HiC-Reg identify topologically associated domains as well as significant interactions that are enriched for CTCF bi-directional motifs and agree well with interactions identified from complementary long-range interaction assays. Taken together, HiC-Reg provides a powerful framework to generate high-resolution profiles of contact counts that can be used to study individual locus level interactions as well as higher-order organizational units of the genome.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/01/406322</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin></item><item><engagementRate>29.0</engagementRate><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06135-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1536303600000</published><entities><item><mentions><item><text>GE Healthcare</text></item></mentions><label>GE Healthcare</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/GE Healthcare</id><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>GUS</text></item></mentions><label>GUS</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/gus</id><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>SDS</text></item></mentions><label>SDS</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/sds</id><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>MA</text></item></mentions><label>MA</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/ma</id><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co.

I noticed people on my Twitter feed yesterday talking about reading theirs during seminars, which led to comments about falling asleep during them (and waking up). So let’s hear them: your worst moments (yours or those you’ve witnessed) about people losing consciousness or focus during scientific talks. I’ve written before &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/09/18/the_worst_seminar&quot;&gt;about awful talks&lt;/a&gt;, and those will certainly overlap, since the real stinkers tend to wipe out susceptible members of the audience. And I’ve also written about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/10/28/out_the_door_and_down_the_stairs&quot;&gt;(growing) intolerance&lt;/a&gt; for less-than-interesting talks in general, and maybe it would go better for me if I could just sack out &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;, but I never really do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve certainly been around people who can! One guy in grad school tended to zonk out within the first ten minutes of most talks – impressive speed, and it made me wonder if he was getting enough sleep at home. Another grad school seminar comes to mind as well. It was a pretty deadly one – I don’t recall the exact topic, except I found it violently uninteresting and delivered at roughly dictation speed. The professor who’d invited this speaker in to bore us all into a coma threw the floor open to questions at the end, only to be met with a terrible gaping silence, one that looked fit to stretch as long as he was willing to let it. So he hurriedly moved to the “Well &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have a question” mode, and said “You know, when you were talking about X, it reminded me of a problem that one of my own students is facing on his project. Do you have any comment on that, Paul?” Silence. Total silence. “Paul?” Silence. Someone hurriedly shook Paul himself awake, and came the bleary response “Uh. . .what was the question again?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s hear it: have you have been the person suddenly awakened and expected to come up with something coherent – you know, as if you’d been listening the whole time?

Functional-effective connectivity and network topology are nowadays key issues for studying brain physiological functions and pathologies. Inferring neuronal connectivity from electrophysiological recordings presents open challenges and unsolved problems. In this work, we present a cross-correlation based method for reliably estimating not only excitatory but also inhibitory links, by analyzing multi-unit spike activity from large-scale neuronal networks. The method is validated by means of realistic simulations of large-scale neuronal populations. New results related to functional connectivity estimation and network topology identification obtained by experimental electrophysiological recordings from high-density and large-scale (i.e., 4096 electrodes) microtransducer arrays coupled to &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; neural populations are presented. Specifically, we show that: (i) functional inhibitory connections are accurately identified in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cortical networks, providing that a reasonable firing rate and recording length are achieved; (ii) small-world topology, with scale-free and rich-club features are reliably obtained, on condition that a minimum number of active recording sites are available. The method and procedure can be directly extended and applied to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; multi-units brain activity recordings.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I7N0_alGOGE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vito Paolo Pastore, Paolo Massobrio, Aleksandar Godjoski, Sergio Martinoia&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, RIPK1 plays a critical role in the human immune system.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6404/810.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30777-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1535526000000</published><entities><item><mentions><item><text>Equus caballus</text></item></mentions><label>Horse</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Horse</id></item><item><mentions><item><text>SEM</text></item></mentions><label>SEM</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/sem</id></item></entities><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30777-z</originId><crawled>1535534469177</crawled><visual><height>352</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-30777-z/MediaObjects/41598_2018_30777_Fig1_HTML.png</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/png</contentType></visual><fingerprint>a8019b2e</fingerprint><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16584fc9039:2ac747:4c71e4fe</id><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/ToX3TpXrcE0/s41598-018-30777-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>4</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Amy Victoria Smith</name></author><title>Domestic horses (Equus caballus) discriminate between negative and positive human nonverbal vocalisations</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30777-z</link><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Domestic horses (&lt;i&gt;Equus caballus&lt;/i&gt;) discriminate between negative and positive human nonverbal vocalisations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic horses (&amp;lt;i&gt;Equus caballus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) discriminate between negative and positive human nonverbal vocalisations, Published online: 29 August 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30777-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-30777-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Domestic horses (&lt;i&gt;Equus caballus&lt;/i&gt;) discriminate between negative and positive human nonverbal vocalisations&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ToX3TpXrcE0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Domestic horses (&lt;i&gt;Equus caballus&lt;/i&gt;) discriminate between negative and positive human nonverbal vocalisations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic horses (&amp;lt;i&gt;Equus caballus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) discriminate between negative and positive human nonverbal vocalisations, Published online: 29 August 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30777-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-30777-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Domestic horses (&lt;i&gt;Equus caballus&lt;/i&gt;) discriminate between negative and positive human nonverbal vocalisations&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ToX3TpXrcE0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1535353200000</published><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/401513v1?rss=1</originId><crawled>1535413630769</crawled><fingerprint>f934c6d6</fingerprint><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1657dc8b731:68597c:b99eedab</id><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/401513v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><description>More and more 3C/Hi-C experiments on prokaryotes have been published.

That’s especially true as people search for higher-temperature materials, because that seems to involve more and more complex synthesis and characterization of the results. Very tiny changes in conditions or starting materials can make for huge differences in the behavior of the final products, and figuring out the atomic-level structures (not just unit cells, but defects, grain/domain sizes, interface effects, and so on) is a major analytical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08572&quot;&gt;preprint showed up&lt;/a&gt; claiming room-temperature superconductivity in a mixture of gold and silver nanoparticles. That’s one out of deep left field, for sure, but so were the (by now well established) copper-oxide materials. This latest result really doesn’t seem likely at all, but you can’t quite rule anything out in this area. And the potential impacts of a room-temp superconductor are so gigantic (scientifically, economically, etc.) that even low-probability claims deserve a hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That hearing they have gotten, and so far it doesn’t look good. Here’s Brian Skinner, a post-doc at MIT (and author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;this physics blog&lt;/a&gt;) with &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02929&quot;&gt;a look at the original data&lt;/a&gt;. What he finds is disturbing: in a plot of magnetic susceptibility versus temperature, two completely separate runs of data (taken at different magnetic field strengths) appear to have &lt;em&gt;exactly the same noise pattern&lt;/em&gt;. That is, whenever one of them zigs a bit up or down, so does the other. Every time. Perfectly in synch. It looks, in fact, as if someone copy-pasted one of the lines, changed the color of the points, and offset the new line a bit. Actually, it’s even worse than that: it looks like someone did that for just part of the figure – at the higher temperatures, the noise in the two runs are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t possible. Noise is noise, and it’s different every time you take a series of measurements. As Skinner delicately puts it, this behavior “has no obvious theoretical explanation”, but by gosh it has a very obvious practical one that is immediately obvious to even a casual observer. That is, someone copy-pasted one of the lines, changed the color of the points, and offset the new line a bit. If there were doubts about the validity of this report before this, they shrink into nothing compared to the doubts that people have now. Think about it: if you were about to report a world-changing result like a room-temperature superconductor, wouldn’t you want to make sure that everything about the paper was solid? Go over it a time or two? Make sure that a key figure didn’t include an obvious copy/paste that would call into question the veracity of the whole damn thing? The name “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6n_scandal&quot;&gt;Jan Hendrik Schön&lt;/a&gt;” comes to mind, and that’s not something anyone wants to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gravity_levity/status/1027717419400392705&quot;&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; from Skinner with some updates since his own note came out. The authors, he says, are sticking by their results, so it’s going to be something to watch. For my part, I certainly hope that an RT superconductor gets discovered. But this isn’t looking good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: OK, this story is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gravity_levity/status/1029061204919177216&quot;&gt;getting weirder&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot further from what should be happening if this were a real discovery. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><alternate><item><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/08/13/a-room-temperature-superconductor-well</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><fingerprint>9f2b0292</fingerprint><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_165338f331d:57e0f32:4db7ac35</id><title>A Room Temperature Superconductor?

Normalization removes systematic biases in sequencing coverage between cells, while the log-transformation ensures that downstream computational procedures operate on relative rather than absolute differences in expression. We show that the log-transformation can introduce systematic errors when cells vary in sequencing coverage, leading to spurious non-zero differences in expression and artificial population structure in simulations.

For example, gene expression is accurately measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries, protein-DNA interactions are captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), protein-RNA interactions by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP-Seq) or RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP-Seq) sequencing, DNA accessibility by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-Seq), and DNase or MNase sequencing libraries. Analysis of these sequencing techniques involve library-specific approaches. However, in all cases, once the sequencing libraries are processed, the result is a count table specifying the estimated number of reads originating from a genomic locus. Differential analysis to determine which loci have different cellular activity under different conditions starts with the count table and iterates through a cycle of data assessment, preparation and analysis. Such iterative approach relies on multiple programs and is therefore a challenge for those without programming skills. Results: We developed DEBrowser, as an R bioconductor project, to interactively visualize each step of the differential analysis of count data, without any requirement for programming expertise. The application presents a rich and interactive web based graphical user interface based on R&apos;s shiny infrastructure. We use shiny&apos;s reactive programming interface for a dynamic webpage that responds to user input and integrates its visualization widgets at each stage of the analysis. In this way, every step of the analysis can be displayed in one application that combines many approaches and multiple results. We show DEBrowser&apos;s capabilities by reproducing the analysis of two previously published data sets. Conclusions: DEBrowser is a flexible, intuitive, web-based analysis platform that enables an iterative and interactive analysis of count data without any requirement of programming knowledge.</description><author><name>Kucukural, A.</name></author><title>DEBrowser: Interactive Differential Expression Analysis and Visualization Tool for Count Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/399931v2?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Sequencing data has become a standard measure for studying diverse cellular activities.

Precise positioning of the cell division site is essential for the correct segregation of the genetic material into the two daughter cells. In the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Myxococcus xanthus&lt;/i&gt;, the proteins PomX and PomY form a cluster on the chromosome that performs a biased random walk to midcell and positively regulates cell division there. PomZ, an ATPase, is necessary for tethering of the cluster to the nucleoid and regulates its movement towards midcell. It has remained unclear how the cluster dynamics change when the biochemical parameters, such as the attachment rates of PomZ dimers to the nucleoid and the cluster, the ATP hydrolysis rate of PomZ or the mobility of PomZ interacting with the nucleoid and cluster, are varied. To answer these questions, we investigate a one-dimensional model that includes the nucleoid, the Pom cluster and PomZ proteins. We find that a mechanism based on the diffusive PomZ fluxes on the nucleoid into the cluster can explain the latter’s midnucleoid localization for a broad parameter range. Furthermore, there is an ATP hydrolysis rate that minimizes the time the cluster needs to reach midnucleoid. If the dynamics of PomZ on the nucleoid is slow relative to the cluster’s velocity, we observe oscillatory cluster movements around midnucleoid. To understand midnucleoid localization, we developed a semi-analytical approach that dissects the net movement of the cluster into its components: the difference in PomZ fluxes into the cluster from either side, the force exerted by a single PomZ dimer on the cluster and the effective friction coefficient of the cluster. Importantly, we predict that the Pom cluster oscillates around midnucleoid if the diffusivity of PomZ on the nucleoid is reduced. A similar approach to that applied here may also prove useful for cargo localization in ParAB&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Oek9-pLqwys&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Silke Bergeler, Erwin Frey&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer cell lines are widely-used models to study cancer biology and test drug candidates, yet it is still unknown to what extent do they adequately resemble the disease in patients. The recent accumulation of large-scale genomic data in cell lines, organoids, mouse models, and patient tissue samples provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the suitability of cancer cell lines as models for metastatic cancer research. Using metastatic breast cancer as a case study, we systematically evaluate their suitability as models for metastatic cancer research. The comprehensive comparison of the genomic profiles of 57 breast cancer cell lines with those of metastatic breast cancer samples revealed substantial genomic differences. We also identified cell lines that more closely resemble different subtypes of metastatic breast cancer. Surprisingly, a combined analysis of mutation, copy number variation and gene expression data suggested that MDAMB231, the most commonly used triple negative cell line, had little genomic similarity with Basal-like metastatic breast cancer samples. In addition to cell lines, we analyzed the RNA-Seq data of patient-derived organoids and found organoids outperformed cell lines in resembling the transcriptome of metastatic breast cancer samples. Finally, we characterized systematic difference between metastatic breast cancer and the in vitro models.

Forecasting the emergence and spread of influenza viruses is an important public health challenge. Timely and accurate estimates of influenza prevalence, particularly of severe cases requiring hospitalization, can improve control measures to reduce transmission and mortality. Here, we extend a previously published machine learning method for influenza forecasting to integrate multiple diverse data sources, including traditional surveillance data, electronic health records, internet search traffic, and social media activity. Our hierarchical framework uses multi-linear regression to combine forecasts from multiple data sources and greedy optimization with forward selection to sequentially choose the most predictive combinations of data sources. We show that the systematic integration of complementary data sources can substantially improve forecast accuracy over single data sources. When forecasting the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza-like-illness reports (ILINet) from week 48 through week 20, the optimal combination of predictors includes public health surveillance data and commercially available electronic medical records, but neither search engine nor social media data.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GOZzg2Ktwrg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zeynep Ertem, Dorrie Raymond, Lauren Ancel Meyers&lt;/p&gt;

biomedical repositories such as the UK Biobank provide unprecedented access to prospectively collected cardiac imaging data, however the majority of these data are unlabeled, creating barriers to their use in supervised machine learning. We developed a weakly supervised deep learning model for Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) classification using up to 4,000 unlabeled cardiac MRI sequences. Instead of requiring curated, hand-labeled training data, weak supervision relies on noisy heuristics defined by domain experts to programmatically generate large-scale, imperfect training labels. For BAV classification, training models using these imperfect labels substantially outperformed a traditional supervised model trained on hand-labeled MRIs. In a validation experiment using long-term outcome data from the UK Biobank, our classification model identified a subset of individuals with a 1.8-fold increase in risk of a major adverse cardiac event. This work formalizes the first deep learning baseline for aortic valve classification and outlines a general strategy for using weak supervision to train machine learning models using large collections of unlabeled medical images.</description><author><name>Fries, J.

Metabolic engineering increasingly depends upon RNA technology to customly rewire the metabolism to maximize production. To this end, pure riboregulators allow dynamic gene repression without the need of a potentially burdensome coexpressed protein like typical Hfq binding small RNAs and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats technology. Despite this clear advantage, no clear general design principles are available to &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; develop repressing riboregulators, limiting the availability and the reliable development of these type of riboregulators. Here, to overcome this lack of knowledge on the functionality of repressing riboregulators, translation inhibiting RNAs are developed from scratch. These &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; developed riboregulators explore features related to thermodynamical and structural factors previously attributed to translation initiation modulation. In total, 12 structural and thermodynamic features were defined of which six features were retained after removing correlations from an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; generated riboregulator library. From this translation inhibiting RNA library, 18 riboregulators were selected using a experimental design and subsequently constructed and co-expressed with two target untranslated regions to link the translation inhibiting RNA features to functionality. The pure riboregulators in the design of experiments showed repression down to 6% of the original protein expression levels, which could only be partially explained by a ordinary least squares regression model. To allow reliable forward engineering, a partial least squares regression model was constructed and validated to link the properties of translation inhibiting RNA riboregulators to gene repression. In this model both structural and thermodynamic features were important for efficient gene repression by pure riboregulators. This approach enables a more reliable &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; forward engineering of effective pure riboregulators, which further expands the RNA toolbox for gene expression modulation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eHvHrDTnq_0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gert Peters, Jo Maertens, Jeroen Lammertyn, Marjan De Mey&lt;/p&gt;

This allows the user not only to focus on specific systems, but also to study general properties of the structure and evolution of membrane proteins.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/15/391961</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1535958000000</published><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/406603v1?rss=1</originId><crawled>1536008857036</crawled><fingerprint>55d93826</fingerprint><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_165a14325cc:26fac8e:4c71e4fe</id><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/406603v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><description>Motivation: Direct-coupling analysis (DCA) for studying the coevolution of residues in proteins has been widely used to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its sequence. Current algorithms for DCA, although efficient, have a high computational cost of determining Direct Information (DI) values for large proteins or domains. In this paper, we present RADI (Reduced Alphabet Direct Information), a variation of the original DCA algorithm that simplifies the computation of DI values by grouping physicochemically equivalent residues. Results: We have compared the first top ranking 40 pairs of DI values and their closest paired contact in 3D. The ranking is also compared with results obtained using a similar but faster approach based on Mutual Information (MI). When we simplify the number of symbols used to describe a protein sequence to 9, RADI achieves similar results as the original DCA (i.e. with the classical alphabet of 21 symbols), while reducing the computation time around 30-fold on large proteins (with length around 1000 residues) and with higher accuracy than predictions based on MI. Interestingly, the simplification produced by grouping amino acids into only two groups (polar and non-polar) is still representative of the physicochemical nature that characterizes the protein structure, having a relevant and useful predictive value, while the computation time is reduced between 100 and 2500-fold. Availability: RADI is available at https://github.com/structuralbioinformatics/RADI Supplementary information: Supplementary data is available in the git repository.</description><author><name>Anton, B.</name></author><title>RADI (Reduced Alphabet Direct Information): Improving execution time for direct-coupling analysis [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/406603v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Direct-coupling analysis (DCA) for studying the coevolution of residues in proteins has been widely used to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its sequence.

We applied SCDT on simulated and real maternal plasma samples, and target cf-DNA sequencing of 118 normal individuals and 240 cancer patients, and demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/07/411256</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05958-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1535353200000</published><entities><item><mentions><item><text>LRRK2</text></item><item><text>Lrrk2</text></item></mentions><label>LRRK2</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/LRRK2</id></item><item><mentions><item><text>MA</text></item></mentions><label>MA</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/ma</id></item><item><mentions><item><text>Abcam</text></item></mentions><label>Abcam</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Abcam</id></item></entities><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05958-z</originId><crawled>1535361845716</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>72b588b</fingerprint><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1657ab289d4:20f50a:4c71e4fe</id><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/WiYJDYKVeX0/s41467-018-05958-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Eun-Jin Bae</name></author><title>LRRK2 kinase regulates α-synuclein propagation via RAB35 phosphorylation</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05958-z</link><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LRRK2 kinase regulates α-synuclein propagation via RAB35 phosphorylation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LRRK2 kinase regulates α-synuclein propagation via RAB35 phosphorylation, Published online: 27 August 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05958-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05958-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mutations in LRRK2 kinase are associated with Parkinson’s disease.

The mechanism of rapid energy supply to the brain, especially to accommodate the heightened metabolic activity of excited states, is not well-understood. We explored the role of glycogen as a fuel source for neuromodulation using the noradrenergic stimulation of glia in a computational model of the neural-glial-vasculature ensemble (NGV). The detection of norepinephrine (NE) by the astrocyte and the coupled cAMP signal are rapid and largely insensitive to the distance of the locus coeruleus projection release sites from the glia, implying a diminished impact for volume transmission in high affinity receptor transduction systems. Glucosyl-conjugated units liberated from glial glycogen by NE-elicited cAMP second messenger transduction winds sequentially through the glycolytic cascade, generating robust increases in NADH and ATP before pyruvate is finally transformed into lactate. This astrocytic lactate is rapidly exported by monocarboxylate transporters to the associated neuron, demonstrating that the astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle activated by glycogenolysis is a likely fuel source for neuromodulation and enhanced neural activity. Altogether, the energy supply for both astrocytes and neurons can be supplied rapidly by glycogenolysis upon neuromodulatory stimulus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6DA81-uUvVk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jay S.

Anticipating epidemic size ahead of season can contribute to preparedness and more targetted control and prevention of seasonal influenza. Methods: A recently developed process-based epidemiological model that incorporates evolutionary change of the virus and generates incidence forecasts for the H3N2 subtype ahead of the season, was previously validated by several statistical criteria, including an accurate real-time prediction for the 2016-2017 influenza season. With this model, a new forecast is generated here for the upcoming 2018-2019 season. The accuracy of predictions published for the 2017-2018 season is also retrospectively evaluated. Results: For 2017-2018, the model correctly predicted the dominance of the H3N2 subtype and its higher than average incidence. Based on surveillance and sequence data up to June 2018, the new forecast for the upcoming 2018-2019 season indicates low levels for H3N2, and suggests an H1N1 dominant season with low incidence of influenza B. Discussion: Real-time forecasts, those generated with a model that was parameterized based on data preceding the predicted season, allows valuable evaluation of the approach. Anticipating the dominant subtype and the size of the upcoming epidemic ahead of season informs disease control. Further studies are needed to promote more accurate ahead-of-season forecasts and extend the approach to multiple subtypes.</description><author><name>Du, X.</name></author><title>Influenza incidence prediction for the United States: an update for the 2018-2019 season [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/411348v1?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Introduction: Seasonal influenza causes a high disease burden every year in the United States and worldwide.

These findings yield insight into the physics of heat conduction in solids and show BAs to be the only known semiconductor with ultrahigh thermal conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6402/582.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05381-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1534143600000</published><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05381-4</originId><crawled>1534152617616</crawled><visual><height>273</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-05381-4/MediaObjects/41467_2018_5381_Fig1_HTML.png</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/png</contentType></visual><fingerprint>1c9a92f0</fingerprint><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_165329f2e90:563d124:4c71e4fe</id><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/vzZTqmvKCpo/s41467-018-05381-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>13</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Adam Creamer</name></author><title>Post-polymerisation functionalisation of conjugated polymer backbones and its application in multi-functional emissive nanoparticles</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05381-4</link><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post-polymerisation functionalisation of conjugated polymer backbones and its application in multi-functional emissive nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-polymerisation functionalisation of conjugated polymer backbones and its application in multi-functional emissive nanoparticles, Published online: 13 August 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05381-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05381-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Functionalisation of conjugated polymers is essential for performance in many applications, yet there are limited approaches to achieve this.

To facilitate interpretation, such data must be organised and processed within scalable computing resources that encapsulate virology expertise. GLUE (Genes Linked by Underlying Evolution) is a data-centric bioinformatics environment for building such resources. The GLUE core data schema organises sequence data along evolutionary lines, capturing not only nucleotide data but associated items such as alignments, genotype definitions, genome annotations and motifs. Its flexible design emphasises applicability to different viruses and to diverse needs within research, clinical or public health contexts.

It includes an interactive public web application providing sequence analysis in the form of a maximum-likelihood-based genotyping method, antiviral resistance detection and graphical sequence visualisation. HCV sequence data from GenBank is categorised and stored in a large-scale sequence alignment which is accessible via web-based queries. Whereas this web resource provides a range of basic functionality, the underlying GLUE project can also be downloaded and extended by bioinformaticians addressing more advanced questions.

Thus, IPA1 promotes both yield and disease resistance by sustaining a balance between growth and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6406/1026.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0192-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1536303600000</published><entities><item><mentions><item><text>CSS</text></item></mentions><label>Cascading Style Sheets</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Cascading Style Sheets</id><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>Explorer</text></item></mentions><label>Explorer</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/explorer</id><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>JavaScript</text></item></mentions><label>JavaScript</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/JavaScript</id><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0192-6</originId><crawled>1536334041193</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>7eb873c4</fingerprint><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_165b4a51069:509a1e:6f86c10b</id><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/BP_OpIfk_zI/s41591-018-0192-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Hannah Stower</name></author><title>Restoring sight with native cell reprogramming</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0192-6</link><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restoring sight with native cell reprogramming&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring sight with native cell reprogramming, Published online: 07 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0192-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0192-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Restoring sight with native cell reprogramming&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/BP_OpIfk_zI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restoring sight with native cell reprogramming&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring sight with native cell reprogramming, Published online: 07 September 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0192-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0192-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Restoring sight with native cell reprogramming&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/BP_OpIfk_zI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05508-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1533625200000</published><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05508-7</originId><crawled>1533634033041</crawled><visual><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-05508-7/MediaObjects/41467_2018_5508_Fig2_HTML.png</url><width>667</width><contentType>image/png</contentType></visual><fingerprint>5c358efc</fingerprint><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16513b63591:2e987a6:6f86c10b</id><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/MRRWMruozTs/s41467-018-05508-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>86</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Zafir Zaman</name></author><title>Persistent structures in a three-dimensional dynamical system with flowing and non-flowing regions</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05508-7</link><unread>False</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Persistent structures in a three-dimensional dynamical system with flowing and non-flowing regions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent structures in a three-dimensional dynamical system with flowing and non-flowing regions, Published online: 07 August 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05508-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05508-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Understanding mixing in yield stress materials, such as paint and sand, is complicated due to the coexistence of solid-like and fluid-like regimes.

A central challenge in sensory neuroscience involves understanding how neural circuits shape computations across cascaded cell layers. Here we attempt to reconstruct the response properties of experimentally unobserved neurons in the interior of a multilayered neural circuit, using cascaded linear-nonlinear (LN-LN) models. We combine non-smooth regularization with proximal consensus algorithms to overcome difficulties in fitting such models that arise from the high dimensionality of their parameter space. We apply this framework to retinal ganglion cell processing, learning LN-LN models of retinal circuitry consisting of thousands of parameters, using 40 minutes of responses to white noise. Our models demonstrate a 53% improvement in predicting ganglion cell spikes over classical linear-nonlinear (LN) models. Internal nonlinear subunits of the model match properties of retinal bipolar cells in both receptive field structure and number. Subunits have consistently high thresholds, supressing all but a small fraction of inputs, leading to sparse activity patterns in which only one subunit drives ganglion cell spiking at any time. From the model’s parameters, we predict that the removal of visual redundancies through stimulus decorrelation across space, a central tenet of efficient coding theory, originates primarily from bipolar cell synapses. Furthermore, the composite nonlinear computation performed by retinal circuitry corresponds to a boolean OR function applied to bipolar cell feature detectors. Our methods are statistically and computationally efficient, enabling us to rapidly learn hierarchical non-linear models as well as efficiently compute widely used descriptive statistics such as the spike triggered average (STA) and covariance (STC) for high dimensional stimuli. This general computational framework may aid in extracting principles of nonlinear hierarchical sensory processing across diverse modalities from limited data.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oIPwD8-KVAo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Niru Maheswaranathan, David B.

This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of rotation. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small rotation angles, the device characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moiré superlattice. The ability to investigate arbitrary rotation angle in a single device reveals features of the optical, mechanical, and electronic response in this system not captured in static rotation studies.

This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of rotation. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ.

In mouse genetic models of hepatocyte injury and senescence, we observed transmission of senescence to local uninjured hepatocytes. Spread of senescence depended on macrophage-derived transforming growth factor–β1 (TGFβ1) ligand. In acetaminophen poisoning, inhibition of TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFβR1) improved mouse survival. TGFβR1 inhibition reduced senescence and enhanced liver regeneration even when delivered beyond the therapeutic window for treating acetaminophen poisoning.

This mechanism, in which injury-induced senescence impairs liver regeneration, is an attractive therapeutic target for developing treatments for acute liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/454/eaan1230.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1535045409000</published><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6404/763-d?rss=1</originId><crawled>1535047129607</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16567f05a07:9d94d42:4c71e4fe</id><keywords><item>Epidemiology</item></keywords><fingerprint>d066663</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6404/763-d?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><author><name>Ash, C.</name></author><title>Hidden truths of enteroviruses</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/361/6404/763-d?rss=1</link><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6404/763.4.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31543-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1536130800000</published><entities><item><mentions><item><text>CPE</text></item></mentions><label>CPE</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/cpe</id><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>STs</text></item><item><text>pneumoniae</text></item><item><text>pneumoniae STs</text></item></mentions><label>pneumoniae STs</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/pneumoniae sts</id><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>cloacae</text></item></mentions><label>cloacae</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/cloacae</id><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>RF</text></item></mentions><label>RF</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/rf</id><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>bla KPC</text></item><item><text>bla</text></item><item><text>KPC</text></item></mentions><label>bla KPC</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/bla kpc</id><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item></entities><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31543-x</originId><crawled>1536139139238</crawled><visual><height>186</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-31543-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_31543_Fig1_HTML.png</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/png</contentType></visual><fingerprint>c89e0a1a</fingerprint><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_165a90718a6:2af596:b99eedab</id><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/K3F1zGOdoBQ/s41598-018-31543-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Christiaan A.

One essential step in many analyses lies in identifying orthologs -- corresponding genes across multiple species -- but this is far from trivial. The OMA (Orthologous MAtrix) database is a leading resource for identifying orthologs among publicly available, complete genomes. Here, we describe the OMA pipeline available as a standalone program for Linux and Mac. When run on a cluster, it has native support for the LSF, SGE, PBS Pro, and Slurm job schedulers and can scale up to thousands of parallel processes. Another key feature of OMA standalone is that users can combine their own data with existing public data by exporting genomes and pre-computed alignments from the OMA database, which currently contains over 2100 complete genomes. We compare OMA standalone to other methods in the context of phylogenetic tree inference, by inferring a phylogeny of the Lophotrochozoa, a challenging clade within the Protostomes. We also discuss other potential applications of OMA standalone, including identifying gene families having undergone duplications/losses in specific clades, and identifying potential drug targets in non-model organisms. OMA Standalone is available at http://omabrowser.org/standalone under the permissible open source Mozilla Public License Version 2.0.</description><author><name>Altenhoff, A.

mesopores. (ii) In contrast to (i), the surface properties of the materials and
their thermal stability under an air atmosphere were
not altered by the use of the different precursors. All materials
exhibited a surface populated by free and uncoordinated carboxylates as well as
inorganic zirconium structures corresponding
to uncoordinated oxo-clusters. The ensemble of these findings contributess to a better understanding of the
features that make MOFs interesting for diverse applications. Particularly,
works on defect engineering may be benefited from the insight on surface
chemistry provided in this contribution.</description><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1534316400000</published><entities><item><mentions><item><text>Siviter et al</text></item><item><text>Siviter</text></item></mentions><label>Siviter et al</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/siviter et al</id></item><item><mentions><item><text>neonicotinoids</text></item></mentions><label>Neonicotinoid</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Neonicotinoid</id></item></entities><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05917-0</originId><crawled>1534354047365</crawled><visual><height>450</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05917-0/d41586-018-05917-0_16029754.jpg</url><width>800</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><fingerprint>f588e01b</fingerprint><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1653ea0c185:67297cf:4c71e4fe</id><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05917-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>6</engagement><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds><author><name>Nigel E.

A high number of sequences encoding repetitive transposases (&gt; 400) were found in the complete genome. The separation of plasmids from genomic DNA revealed that two Type III secretion systems in P. stewartii DC283 are located on two separate mega-plasmids.

PON1 loss also eliminates marine mammals’ main defense against neurotoxicity from specific man-made organophosphorus compounds, implying potential risks in modern environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6402/591.full</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin></item><item><engagementRate>4.0</engagementRate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1536044400000</published><entities><item><mentions><item><text>Brazil</text></item><item><text>Brazilian</text></item></mentions><label>Brazil</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Brazil</id><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>Denise Cavalcante Gomes</text></item><item><text>Gomes</text></item></mentions><label>Denise Cavalcante Gomes</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/denise cavalcante gomes</id><salienceLevel>about</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>Reuters</text></item></mentions><label>Reuters</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Reuters</id><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>Ricardo Moraes</text></item></mentions><label>Ricardo Moraes</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/-/ricardo moraes</id><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item><item><mentions><item><text>Napoleon</text></item></mentions><label>Napoleon</label><id>nlp/f/entity/en/w/Napoleon</id><salienceLevel>mention</salienceLevel></item></entities><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06192-9</originId><crawled>1536084931374</crawled><visual><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06192-9/d41586-018-06192-9_16096574.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><recrawled>1536168174349</recrawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_165a5cbf32e:2d8503b:4c71e4fe</id><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06192-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><fingerprint>86ff0d6d</fingerprint><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds><author><name>Reinaldo José  Lopes</name></author><title>Hope emerges for Brazil museum specimens after devastating fire</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06192-9</link><unread>True</unread><engagement>24</engagement><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hope emerges for Brazil museum specimens after devastating fire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope emerges for Brazil museum specimens after devastating fire, Published online: 04 September 2018;

Investigation of multiple pharmacogenomics datasets confirmed that the pairwise sensitivity data correlation between drugs, or rows, across different studies (drug-wise) is relatively low, while the pairwise sensitivity data correlation between cell-lines, or columns, across different studies (cell-wise) is considerably strong. This common interesting observation across multiple pharmacogenomics datasets suggests the existence of subtle consistency among the different studies (i.e., strong cell-wise correlation).

Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework for addressing the inconsistency between large-scale pharmacogenomics data sets.

Obesity is associated with increased blood concentrations of the anorexigenic hormone leptin; however, obese individuals are resistant to its anorexigenic effects.

This has prompted many investigators to design studies that identify explanatory biomarkers, and then use these biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes. One approach involves using machine learning algorithms to classify patients based on blood mRNA expression from high-throughput transcriptomic assays. However, these endeavours typically fail to achieve the high level of performance, stability, and generalizability required for clinical translation. Moreover, these classifiers can lack interpretability because informative genes do not necessarily have relevance to researchers. For this study, we hypothesized that annotation-based classifiers can improve classification performance, stability, generalizability, and interpretability. To this end, we evaluated the performance of four classification algorithms on six neuropsychiatric data sets using four annotation databases. Our results suggest that the Gene Ontology Biological Process database can transform gene expression into an annotation-based feature space that improves the performance and stability of blood-based classifiers for neuropsychiatric conditions. We also show how annotation features can improve the interpretability of classifiers: since annotation databases are often used to assign biological importance to genes, annotation-based classifiers are easy to interpret because the biological importance of the features are the features themselves. We found that using annotations as features improves the performance and stability of classifiers.

This has prompted many investigators to design studies that identify explanatory biomarkers, and then use these biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes. One approach involves using machine learning algorithms to classify patients based on blood mRNA expression from high-throughput transcriptomic assays. However, these endeavours typically fail to achieve the high level of performance, stability, and generalizability required for clinical translation. Moreover, these classifiers can lack interpretability because informative genes do not necessarily have relevance to researchers. For this study, we hypothesized that annotation-based classifiers can improve classification performance, stability, generalizability, and interpretability. To this end, we evaluated the performance of four classification algorithms on six neuropsychiatric data sets using four annotation databases. Our results suggest that the Gene Ontology Biological Process database can transform gene expression into an annotation-based feature space that improves the performance and stability of blood-based classifiers for neuropsychiatric conditions. We also show how annotation features can improve the interpretability of classifiers: since annotation databases are often used to assign biological importance to genes, annotation-based classifiers are easy to interpret because the biological importance of the features are the features themselves. We found that using annotations as features improves the performance and stability of classifiers. We also noted that the top ranked annotations tend contain the top ranked genes, suggesting that the most predictive annotations are a superset of the most predictive genes. Based on this, and the fact that annotations are used routinely to assign biological importance to genetic data, we recommend transforming gene-level expression into annotation-level expression prior to the classification of neuropsychiatric conditions.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/16/393082</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00935</originId><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00935</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><published>1534305600000</published><author><name>Natalie Fisher, Michael G.

Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network (D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning–based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively.

Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network (D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning–based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We created 3D-printed D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;NNs that implement classification of images of handwritten digits and fashion products, as well as the function of an imaging lens at a terahertz spectrum.

The plan is that by 2020, &lt;em&gt;all such work&lt;/em&gt; must be published in compliant open-access journals or on compliant open-access platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few other provisions as well: authors are to retain copyright without restriction, first off. Standards for that adjective “compliant” will be drawn up and made public for journals and platforms, and in cases where no such entity exists, the agencies will provide incentives and support for their formation. Another key point: “It is acknowledged that all scientists should be able to publish their work Open Access even if their institutions have limited means”, which means that institutions (and not individual researchers) are to pick up the cost, and apparently there will be subsidies available in cases where this isn’t feasible. To that end, open access fees will be standardized and capped across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And publishers take note: the “hybrid” model of publication is explicitly stated not to be compliant. That’s the one where some of the papers in the journal are open access (presumably because the authors paid for them to be) and the rest of them aren’t. The European funding agencies are saying that this isn’t going to cut it: work will be published only in venues that are completely open access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has to be the loudest and highest-caliber shot yet across the bow of the current subscription model in scientific publishing. How will Elsevier, Springer/Nature, Wiley and the others react? How will the scientific societies themselves react? That latter question will emphasize that some of them are, in fact, more publishers than they are scientific societies, at least as how that latter term is popularly perceived. (There are other organizations that are, financially, better thought of as life insurance companies or direct marketing providers than as any sort of membership society, but I don’t know if any of the scientific ones have quite made it to that point or not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, this has potential to really shake things up, and in a pretty short time frame, too. Grab some popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;

Hippocampal damage results in profound retrograde, but no anterograde amnesia in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Although the content learned in the latter have been discussed, alternative regions supporting CFC learning were seldom proposed and never empirically addressed. Here, we employed network analysis of pCREB expression quantified from brain slices of rats with dorsal hippocampal lesion (dHPC) after undergoing CFC session. Using inter-regional correlations of pCREB-positive nuclei between brain regions, we modelled functional networks using different thresholds. The dHPC network showed small-world topology, equivalent to SHAM (control) network. However, diverging hubs were identified in each network. In a direct comparison, hubs in both networks showed consistently higher centrality values compared to the other network. Further, the distribution of correlation coefficients was different between the groups, with most significantly stronger correlation coefficients belonging to the SHAM network. These results suggest that dHPC network engaged in CFC learning is partially different, and engage alternative hubs. We next tested if pre-training lesions of dHPC and one of the new dHPC network hubs (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices) would impair CFC. Only dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per, impaired CFC. Interestingly, only RSC showed a consistently higher centrality in the dHPC network, suggesting that the increased centrality reflects an increased functional dependence on RSC. Our results provide evidence that, without hippocampus, the RSC, an anatomically central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system might support CFC learning and memory.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nut-R4-WNSE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cesar A.

Using inter-regional correlations of pCREB-positive nuclei between brain regions, we modelled functional networks using different thresholds. The dHPC network showed small-world topology, equivalent to SHAM (control) network. However, diverging hubs were identified in each network. In a direct comparison, hubs in both networks showed consistently higher centrality values compared to the other network. Further, the distribution of correlation coefficients was different between the groups, with most significantly stronger correlation coefficients belonging to the SHAM network. These results suggest that dHPC network engaged in CFC learning is partially different, and engage alternative hubs. We next tested if pre-training lesions of dHPC and one of the new dHPC network hubs (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices) would impair CFC. Only dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per, impaired CFC. Interestingly, only RSC showed a consistently higher centrality in the dHPC network, suggesting that the increased centrality reflects an increased functional dependence on RSC. Our results provide evidence that, without hippocampus, the RSC, an anatomically central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system might support CFC learning and memory.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nut-R4-WNSE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin></item><item><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><published>1533279600000</published><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05891-7</originId><crawled>1533647944786</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>b4f3db11</fingerprint><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_165148a7c52:2ed90ad:4c71e4fe</id><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05891-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>9</engagement><webfeeds><icon>https://storage.googleapis.com/test-site-assets/BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO_Py-q6EVKn1X88_oicon-1658664fbd2</icon></webfeeds><author><name>Malak Abedalthagafi</name></author><title>A Jordanian biologist redefines success for women in science</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05891-7</link><unread>False</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Jordanian biologist redefines success for women in science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Jordanian biologist redefines success for women in science, Published online: 03 August 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05891-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05891-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Malak Abedalthagafi extols a memoir from a trailblazer in women’s rights.</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Jordanian biologist redefines success for women in science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Jordanian biologist redefines success for women in science, Published online: 03 August 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05891-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05891-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Malak Abedalthagafi extols a memoir from a trailblazer in women’s rights.</description><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin></item><item><unread>True</unread><published>1536278400000</published><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Pyrococcus_furiosus_Prolyl_Oligopeptidase_A_Dynamic_Supramolecular_Host_for_Peptidase_and_Dirhodium_Catalysis/7053812</originId><crawled>1536331212085</crawled><fingerprint>c30b7319</fingerprint><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_165b479e535:480db7:4c71e4fe</id><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Pyrococcus_furiosus_Prolyl_Oligopeptidase_A_Dynamic_Supramolecular_Host_for_Peptidase_and_Dirhodium_Catalysis/7053812</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>NA</name></author><title>Pyrococcus furiosus Prolyl Oligopeptidase: A Dynamic Supramolecular Host for Peptidase and Dirhodium Catalysis</title><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Pyrococcus_furiosus_Prolyl_Oligopeptidase_A_Dynamic_Supramolecular_Host_for_Peptidase_and_Dirhodium_Catalysis/7053812</link><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Supramolecular catalysis involves the design and characterization of synthetic macromolecules that catalyze chemical reactions.

Allosteric regulation has traditionally been described by mathematically-complex allosteric rate laws in the form of ratios of polynomials derived from the application of simplifying kinetic assumptions. Alternatively, an approach that explicitly describes all known ligand-binding events requires no simplifying assumptions while allowing for the computation of enzymatic states. Here, we employ such a modeling approach to examine the “catalytic potential” of an enzyme—an enzyme’s capacity to catalyze a biochemical reaction. The catalytic potential is the fundamental result of multiple ligand-binding events that represents a “tug of war” among the various regulators and substrates within the network. This formalism allows for the assessment of interacting allosteric enzymes and development of a network-level understanding of regulation. We first define the catalytic potential and use it to characterize the response of three key kinases (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase) in human red blood cell glycolysis to perturbations in ATP utilization. Next, we examine the sensitivity of the catalytic potential by using existing personalized models, finding that the catalytic potential allows for the identification of subtle but important differences in how individuals respond to such perturbations. Finally, we explore how the catalytic potential can help to elucidate how enzymes work in tandem to maintain a homeostatic state. Taken together, this work provides an interpretation and visualization of the dynamic interactions and network-level effects of interacting allosteric enzymes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cFSQuS8gwrc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><description>&lt;p&gt;by James T.

Additionally, users can customize analysis parameters, by choosing from the different significance tests to conduct advanced statistics. Currently, GenFam supports gene family classification and enrichment analyses for seventy-eight plant genomes.

Additionally, users can customize analysis parameters, by choosing from the different significance tests to conduct advanced statistics. Currently, GenFam supports gene family classification and enrichment analyses for seventy-eight plant genomes. Conclusions: GenFam implements a unique approach to classify and interpret enriched biological information in terms of gene families from user input of differentially expressed gene datasets. The GenFam application is open-source and accessible through world-wide web at http://mandadilab.webfactional.com/home/.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/18/272187</canonicalUrl><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin></item></channel></rss>
