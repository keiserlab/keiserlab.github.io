    <p>Michael is a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Ben Barres Investigator and a Paul G. Allen Distinguished Investigator. Michael joined the UCSF faculty in 2014, in the Dept. of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, with appointments in the Dept. of Bioengineering & Therapeutic Sciences and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute. He is also a member of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute and the Kavli Institute for Fundamental Neuroscience at UCSF.</p>
    <p>Before this, he co-founded a startup bringing systems pharmacology methods for drug-target prediction to pharma and the US FDA, where they are in use today. During his bioinformatics Ph.D. at UCSF as a NSF Fellow, Michael developed techniques to relate drugs and proteins from the statistical similarity of their ligands, such as the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA). He holds multiple degrees from Stanford, including a BSc. in Computer Science.</p>
